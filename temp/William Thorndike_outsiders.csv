The business of business is a lot of little decisions every day mixed up with a few big decisions.,The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike,[]
"Basically, CEOs have five essential choices for deploying capital—investing in existing operations, acquiring other businesses, issuing dividends, paying down debt, or repurchasing stock—and three alternatives for raising it—tapping internal cash flow, issuing debt, or raising equity. Think of these options collectively as a tool kit. Over the long term, returns for shareholders will be determined largely by the decisions a CEO makes in choosing which tools to use (and which to avoid) among these various options. Stated simply, two companies with identical operating results and different approaches to allocating capital will derive two very different long-term outcomes for shareholders.",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
"There is a fundamental humility to decentralization, an admission that headquarters does not have all the answers and that much of the real value is created by local managers in the field.",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike,[]
"Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks. —Warren Buffett",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
"You are right not because others agree with you, but because your facts and reasoning are sound. —Benjamin Graham",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike,[]
"The lessons of these iconoclastic CEOs suggest a new, more nuanced conception of the chief executive’s job, with less emphasis placed on charismatic leadership and more on careful deployment of firm resources.",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
"If you think of capital allocation more broadly as resource allocation and include the deployment of human resources, you find again that Singleton had a highly differentiated approach. Specifically, he believed in an extreme form of organizational decentralization with a wafer-thin corporate staff at headquarters and operational responsibility and authority concentrated in the general managers of the business units. This was very different from the approach of his peers, who typically had elaborate headquarters staffs replete with vice presidents and MBAs.",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]

There are two basic types of resources that any CEO needs to allocate: financial and human.,The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
Decentralization is the cornerstone of our philosophy. Our goal is to hire the best people we can and give them the responsibility and authority they need to perform their jobs. All decisions are made at the local level. . . . We expect our managers . . . to be forever cost conscious and to recognize and exploit sales potential.,The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
The system in place corrupts you with so much autonomy and authority that you can’t imagine leaving.,The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
"What makes him a leader is precisely that he is able to think things through for himself. —William Deresiewicz, lecture to West Point plebe class, October 2009",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
need to know three things to evaluate a CEO’s greatness: the compound annual return to shareholders during his or her tenure and the return over the same period for peer companies and for the broader market (usually measured by the S&P 500).,The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike,[]

"It’s remarkable how much value can be created by a small group of really talented people. —David Wargo, Putnam Investments",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
"Murphy’s approach to the roll-up was different. He moved slowly, developed real operational expertise, and focused on a small number of large acquisitions that he knew to be high-probability bets. Under Murphy, Capital Cities combined excellence in both operations and capital allocation to an unusual degree. As Murphy told me, “The business of business is a lot of little decisions every day mixed up with a few big decisions.",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
"In contrast, Murphy’s goal was to make his company more valuable. As he said to me, “The goal is not to have the longest train, but to arrive at the station first using the least fuel.”2",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
"One of the most important decisions any CEO makes is how he spends his time—specifically, how much time he spends in three essential areas: management of operations, capital allocation, and investor relations.",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike,[]
"Teledyne return, which by averaging cash flow and net income for each business unit, emphasized cash generation and became the basis for bonus compensation for all business unit general managers.",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
"A story from this time demonstrates the culture clash between network executives and the leaner, more entrepreneurial acquirers. ABC, in fact the whole broadcasting industry, was a limousine culture—one of the most cherished perks for an industry executive was the ability to take a limo for even a few blocks to lunch. Murphy, however, was a cab man and from very early on showed up to all ABC meetings in cabs. Before long, this practice rippled through the ABC executive ranks, and the broader Capital Cities ethos slowly began to permeate the ABC culture. When asked whether this was a case of leading by example, Murphy responded, “Is there any other way?",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike,[]
"CBS spent much of the 1960s and 1970s taking the enormous cash flow generated by its network and broadcast operations and funding an aggressive acquisition program that led it into entirely new fields, including the purchase of a toy business and the New York Yankees baseball team. CBS issued stock to fund some of these acquisitions, built a landmark office building in midtown Manhattan at enormous expense, developed a corporate structure with forty-two presidents and vice presidents, and generally displayed what Buffett’s partner, Charlie Munger, calls “a prosperity-blinded indifference to unnecessary costs.”1",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
"Singleton’s fierce independence of mind remained a prominent trait until the end of his life. In 1997, two years before his death from brain cancer at age eighty-two, he sat down with Leon Cooperman, a longtime Teledyne investor. At the time, a number of Fortune 500 companies had recently announced large share repurchases. When Cooperman asked him about them, Singleton responded presciently, “If everyone’s doing them, there must be something wrong with them.",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
"Each ran a highly decentralized organization; made at least one very large acquisition; developed unusual, cash flow–based metrics; and bought back a significant amount of stock. None paid meaningful dividends or provided Wall Street guidance. All received the same combination of derision, wonder, and skepticism from their peers and the business press. All also enjoyed eye-popping, credulity-straining performance over very long tenures (twenty-plus years on average).",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N. Thorndike Jr.,[]
"The formula that allowed Murphy to overtake Paley’s QE2 was deceptively simple: focus on industries with attractive economic characteristics, selectively use leverage to buy occasional large properties, improve operations, pay down debt, and repeat.",The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional Ceos and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,William N.
