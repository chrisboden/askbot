Wanting a lollapalooza result, we will naturally include rewards in all the categories. To start out, it is easy to decide to design our beverage for consumption cold.

"I sought good judgment mostly by collecting instances of bad judgment, then pondering ways to avoid such outcomes. Second, I became so avid a collector of instances of bad judgment that I paid no attention to boundaries between professional territories. After all, why should I search for some tiny, unimportant, hard-to-find new stupidity in my own field when some large, important, easy-to find stupidity was just over the fence in the other fellow's professional territory?","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T.

The people who design easily gameable systems belong in the lowest circle of hell. They just don't think about what terrible things they're doing to the civilization because they don't take into account the second-order effects and the third-order effects in lying and cheating.,"Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T.

"Frequently overlooked is that Ricardo's comparative advantage in ""delegating"" tasks among nations is equally applicable for managers delegating work. Even if a manager can perform the full range of tasks better himself, it is still mutually advantageous to divide them up. If you try and talk like this to economics professors, and I've done this three times, they shrink in horror and offense because they don't like this kind of talk. It really gums up this nice discipline of theirs, which is so much simpler when you ignore second- and third-order consequences.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T.

"Bernard de Mandeville (1670-1733) and ""The Fable of the Bees"" Bernard de Mandeville, philosopher and satirist, published a poem, ""The Fable of the Bees: or, Private Vices, Public Benefits,"" in 1705 as a political satire. Mandeville's philosophy suggests that altruism harms the state and its intellectual progress and that self-interested human vice is the real engine of progress. Thus, he arrives at the paradox that ""private vices are public benefits.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger, Expanded Third Edition",Peter D. Kaufman,[]

"You've got a complex system, and it spews out a lot of wonderful numbers that enable you to measure some factors. But there are other factors that are terribly important, [yet] there's no precise numbering you can put to these factors. You know they're important, but you don't have the numbers. well, practically everybody (1) overweighs the stuff that can be numbered because it yields to the statistical techniques they're taught in academia and(1) Doesn't mix in the hard-to-measure stuff that may be more important.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T.

"In Confucian thought, filial piety-a love and respect for one's parents and ancestors-is a virtue to be cultivated. More broadly, ""filial piety means to take care of one parents; not be rebellious; show love, respect and support; display courtesy; ensure male heirs; uphold fraternity among brothers; wisely advise one parents; conceal their mistakes; display sorrow for their sickness and death; and carry out sacrifices after their death. Confucius believed that if people could learn to fulfill their filial roles properly they would be better able to perform their roles in society and government.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T.

"I have names for Mankiw’s approach, grabbing whatever you need without attribution. Sometimes I call it ""take what you wish,"" and sometimes I call it ""Kiplingism."" And when I call it Kiplingism, I'm reminding you of Kipling's stanza of poetry', which went something like this: ""When Homer smote his blooming lyre, he'd heard men sing by land and sea, and what he thought he might require, he went and took, the same as me.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T.

"Another idea, and this may remind you of Confucius, too, is that the acquisition of wisdom is a moral duty. It's not something you do just to advance in life. And there's a corollary to that idea that is very important. it requires that you are hooked on lifetime learning. Without lifetime learning, you people are not going to do very well. You are not going to get very far in life based on what you already know. You're going to advance in life by what you learn after you leave here.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger, Expanded Third Edition",Peter D. Kaufman,[]
"But once you try to put a lot of false precision into a complex system like economics, the errors can compound to the point where they're worse than those of the McKinsey partner when he was incompetently advising the Washington Post. So, economics should emulate physics' basic ethos, but its search for precision in physics-like formulas is almost always wrong in economics.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T.

"Leslie Schwab was born in Bend, Oregon. After service in the Air Cadet Corps during World War II, he returned to Oregon and bought OK Rubber Welders, a small tire shop that he turned from a $32,000-a-year business into one generating $150,000 annually. In the 1950s, Schwab began expanding his business throughout the Pacific Northwest. Through innovations such as profit sharing, ""supermarket"" product selection, and independence from the tire manufacturing companies, the company now operates over three hundred stores with sales exceeding $l billion annually.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T.

"Extreme success is likely to be caused by some combination of the following factors: A) Extreme maximization or minimization of one or two variables. Example,Costco or our furniture and appliance store. B) Adding success factors so that a bigger combination drives success, often in nonlinear fashion, as one is reminded by the concept of breakpoint and the concept of critical mass in physics. Often results are not linear.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger, Expanded Third Edition",Peter D. Kaufman,[]

"And there I think the attitude of Epictetus helps guide one to the right reaction. He thought that every mischance in life, however bad, created an opportunity to behave well. He believed every mischance provided an opportunity to learn something useful.

"Extreme economic ignorance was displayed when various experts, including Ph. D. economists, forecast the cost of the original Medicare law. They did simple extrapolations of past costs. Well, the cost forecast was off by a factor of more than One Thousand Percent. The cost they projected was less than ten percent of the cost that happened. Once they put in place various new incentives, the behavior changed in response to the incentives, and the numbers became quite different from their projection. And medicine invented new and expensive remedies, as it was sure to do. How could a great group of experts make such a silly forecast? Answer: They oversimplified to get easy figures, like the rube rounding pi to 3.11. They chose not to consider effects of effects on effects. and so on.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger, Expanded Third Edition",Peter D. Kaufman,[]
"There was a wonderful example of gaming a human system in the career of Victor Niederhoffer in the Economics Department of Harvard. Victor Niederhoffer was the son of a police lieutenant, and he needed to get A's at Harvard. But he didn't want to do any serious work at Harvard because what he really liked doing was, one, playing world-class checkers; two, gambling in high-stakes card games, at which he was very good, all hours of the day and night; three, being the squash champion of the United States, which he was for years; and, four, being about as good a tennis player as a part-time tennis player could be. This did not leave much time for getting A's at Harvard. So he went into the Economics Department. You'd think he would have chosen French poetry. But remember, this was a guy who could play championship checkers. He thought he was up to outsmarting the Harvard Economics Department. And he was. He noticed that the graduate students did most of the boring work that would otherwise go to the professors, and he noticed that because it was so hard to get to be a graduate student at Harvard, they were all very brilliant and organized and hardworking, as well as much needed by grateful professors. And, therefore, by custom, and as would be predicted from the psychological force called ""reciprocity tendency,"" in a really advanced graduate course, the professors always gave an A. So Victor Niederhoffer signed up for nothing but the most advanced graduate courses in the Harvard Economics Department, and, of course, he got A, after A, after A, after A, and was hardly ever near a class. And, for a while. Some people at Harvard may have thought it had a new prodigy on its hands. That's a ridiculous story, but the scheme will work still. And Niederhoffer is famous: They call his style ""Niederhoffering the curriculum.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger, Expanded Third Edition",Peter D. Kaufman,[]

"It is not always recognized that, to function best morality should sometimes appear unfair, like most worldly outcomes. The craving for perfect fairness causes a lot of terrible problems in system function. Some systems should be made deliberately unfair to individuals because they'll be fairer on average for all of us.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T.

"I frequently cite the example of having your career over, in the Navy, if your ship goes aground, even if it wasn't your fault. I say the lack of justice for the one guy that wasn't at fault is way more than made up by a greater justice for everybody when every captain of a ship always sweats blood to make sure the ship doesn't go aground. Tolerating a little unfairness to some to get a greater fairness for all is a model I recommend to all of you. But again, I wouldn't put it in your assigned college work if you want to be graded well, particularly in a modern law school wherein there is usually an over-love of fairness-seeking process.","Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T.
