Socialism is an alternative to capitalism as potassium cyanide is an alternative to water.,Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig von Mises,"['aggression', 'anarcho-capitalism', 'anarchy', 'ancap', 'austrian-school-of-economics', 'coercion', 'collectivism', 'communism', 'economics', 'evil', 'free', 'free-market', 'freedom', 'government', 'initiation-of-force', 'laissez-faire', 'libertarian', 'liberty', 'mafia', 'non-aggression-principle', 'state', 'statism', 'taxation', 'theft', 'trade', 'voluntaryism']"
He who only wishes and hopes does not interfere actively with the course of events and with the shaping of his own destiny.,Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig Von Mises,[]
"It is not the fault of the entrepreneurs that the consumers, the people, the common man, prefer liquor to Bibles and detective stories to serious books, and that governments prefer guns to butter. The entrepreneur does not make greater profits in selling bad things than in selling good things. His profits are the greater the better he succeeds in providing the consumers with those things they ask for most intensely.",Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig von Mises,"['economics', 'profit']"
"Praxeology is a theoretical and systematic, not a historical, science. Its scope is human action as such, irrespective of all environmental, accidental, and individual circumstances of the concrete acts. Its cognition is purely formal and general without reference to the material content and the particular features of the actual case. It aims at knowledge valid for all instances in which the conditions exactly correspond to those implied in its assumptions and inferences. Its statements and propositions are not derived from experience. They are, like those of logic and mathematics, a priori. They are not subject to verification or falsification on the ground of experience and facts.",Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig von Mises,"['economics', 'empiricism', 'falsification', 'libertarianism', 'pseudoscience', 'reality', 'science']"
"Without exception all political parties promise their supporters a higher real income. There is no difference in this respect between nationalists and internationalists and between the supporters of a market economy and the advocates of either socialism or interventionism. If a party asks its supporters to make sacrifices for its cause, it always explains these sacrifices as the necessary temporary means for the attainment of the ultimate goal, the improvement of the material well-being of its members. Each party considers it as an insidious plot against its prestige and its survival if somebody ventures to question the capacity of its projects to make the group members more prosperous. Each party regards with a deadly hatred the economists embarking upon such a critique. ",Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig Von Mises,"['economics', 'politics']"
"The body of economic knowledge is an essential element in the structure of human civilization; it is the foundation upon which modern industrialism and all the moral, intellectual, technological, and therapeutical achievements of the last centuries have been built. It rests with men whether they will make the proper use of the rich treasure with which this knowledge provides them or whether they will leave it unused. But if they fail to take the best advantage of it and disregard its teachings and warnings, they will not annul economics; they will stamp out society and the human race.",Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
It is true that some secluded intellectuals in their esoteric circles talk differently. They proclaim the priority of what they call eternal absolute values and feign in their declamations—not in their personal conduct—a disdain of things secular and transitory. But the public ignores such utterances. The main goal of present-day political action is to secure for the respective pressure group memberships the highest material well-being. The only way for a leader to succeed is to instill in people the conviction that his program best serves the attainment of this goal. ,Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig Von Mises,"['economics', 'politics']"
Only very few men have the gift of thinking new and original ideas and of changing the traditional body of creeds and doctrines.,Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
"All varieties of the producers' policy are advocated on the ground of their alleged ability to raise the party members' standard of living. Protectionism and economic self-sufficiency, labor union pressure and compulsion, labor legislation, minimum wage rates, public spending, credit expansion, subsidies, and other makeshifts are always recommended by their advocates as the most suitable or the only means to increase the real income of the people for whose votes they canvass. Every contemporary statesman or politician invariably tells his voters: My program will make you as affluent as conditions may permit, while my adversaries' program will bring you want and misery.",Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig Von Mises,"['economics', 'politics']"
"As regards the social apparatus of repression and coercion, the government, there cannot be any question of freedom. Government is essentially the negation of liberty. It is the recourse to violence or threat of violence in order to make all people obey the orders of the government, whether they like it or not. As far as the government’s jurisdiction extends, there is coercion, not freedom. Government is a necessary institution, the means to make the social system of cooperation work smoothly without being disturbed by violent acts on the part of gangsters whether of domestic or of foreign origin. Government is not, as some people like to say, a necessary evil; it is not an evil, but a means, the only means available to make peaceful human coexistence possible. But it is the opposite of liberty. It is beating, imprisoning, hanging. Whatever a government does it is ultimately supported by the actions of armed constables.",Liberty And Property,Ludwig von Mises,['libertarian']
"Since nobody is in a position to substitute his own value judgments for those of the acting individual, it is vain to pass judgment on other people's aims and volitions. No man is qualified to declare what would make another man happier or less discontented.",Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
"Goals change, ideas of technology are transformed, but action always remains action. Action always seeks means to realize ends, and it is in this sense always rational and mindful of utility. It is, in a word, human.",Epistemological Problems of Economics,Ludwig von mises,[]
"Shortcomings in the governments’ handling of monetary matters and the disastrous consequences of policies aimed at lowering the rate of interest and at encouraging business activities through credit expansion gave birth to the ideas which finally generated the slogan “stabilization.” One can explain its emergence and its popular appeal, one can understand it as the fruit of the last hundred and fifty years’ history of currency and banking, one can, as it were, plead extenuating circumstances for the error involved. But no such sympathetic appreciation can render its fallacies any more tenable.",Human Action,Ludwig von Mises,[]
"It was the ideas of the classical economists that removed the checks imposed by age-old laws, customs, and prejudices upon technological improvement and freed the genius of reformers and innovators from the straitjackets) of the guilds, government tutelage, and social pressure of various kinds. It was they that reduced the prestige of conquerors and expropriators and demonstrated the social benefits derived from business activity.",Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
economics is a living thing—and to live implies both imperfection and change.,Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
"There is joint action, but no joint thinking. There is only tradition which preserves thoughts and communicates them to others as a stimulus to their thinking.",Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
Those fighting for free enterprise and free competition do not defend the interests of those rich today. They want a free hand left to unknown men who will be the entrepreneurs of tomorrow and whose ingenuity will make the life of coming generations more agreeable. They want the way left open to further economic improvements. They are the spokesmen of progress.,Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
"Though the man of action, the politician, may sometimes pay no attention to the results of this examination, the man of thought will never cease to inquire into all things accessible to human intelligence. And in the long run thought must determine action.",Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis,Ludwig von Mises,[]
This civilization was able to spring into existence because the peoples were dominated by ideas which were the application of the teachings of economics to the problems of economic policy. It will and must perish if the nations continue to pursue the course which they entered upon under the spell of doctrines rejecting economic thinking.,Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
It is true that under the wages system the individual is not free to choose permanent unemployment. But no other imaginable social system could grant him a right to unlimited leisure. That man cannot avoid submitting to the disutility of labor is not an outgrowth of any social institution. It is an inescapable natural condition of human life and conduct.,Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
thinking is always thinking of a potential action.,Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]

Human thoughts about things of which neither pure reasoning nor experience provides any knowledge may differ so radically that no agreement can be reached.,Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
"The urge toward action, i.e., improvement of the conditions of life, is inborn in man. Man himself changes from moment to moment and his valuations, volitions, and acts change with him. In the realm of action there is nothing perpetual but change.",Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig von Mises,"['change', 'human-action']"
Men cooperate with one another. The totality of interhuman relations engendered by such cooperation is called society. Society is not an entity in itself. It is an aspect of human action. It does not exist or live outside of the conduct of people. It is an orientation of human action. Society neither thinks nor acts. Individuais in thinking and acting constitute a complex of relations and facts that are called social relations and facts.,Theory and History: An Interpretation of Social and Economic Evolution,Ludwig von Mises,[]
"Reason, intellect, and logic are historical phenomena. There is a history of logic as there is a history of technology. Nothing suggests that logic as we know it is the last and final stage of intellectual evolution. Human logic is a historical phase between prehuman nonlogic on the one hand and superhuman logic on the other hand. Reason and mind, the human beings’ most efficacious equipment in their struggle for survival, are embedded in the continuous flow of zoological events. They are neither eternal nor unchangeable. They are transitory.",Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
"History cannot teach us any general rule, principle, or law. There is no means to abstract from a historical experience a posteriori any theories or theorems concerning human conduct and policies. The",Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
All that society can achieve in these fields is to provide an environment which does not put insurmountable obstacles in the way of genius’s and makes the common man free enough from material concerns to become interested in things other than mere breadwinning... the foremost social means of making a man more human is to fight poverty. Wisdom and science and the arts the way of genius and makes the common man free enough thrive better in a world of affluence than among needy peoples.,Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig von Mises,['ludwig-von-mises']
The economists exploded the old tenets: that it is unfair and unjust to outdo a competitor by producing better and cheaper goods; that it is iniquitous to deviate from the traditional methods of production; that machines are an evil because they bring about unemployment; that it is one of the tasks of civil government to prevent efficient businessmen from getting rich and to protect the less efficient against the competition of the more efficient; that to restrict the freedom of entrepreneurs by government compulsion or by coercion on the part of other social powers is an appropriate means to promote a nation's well-being.,Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
"Freedom and liberty always refer to interhuman relations. A man is free as far as he can live and get on without being at the mercy of arbitrary decisions on the part of other people. In the frame of society everybody depends upon his fellow citizens. Social man cannot become independent without forsaking all the advantages of social cooperation. The self-sufficient individual is independent, but he is not free. He is at the mercy of everybody who is stronger than himself.",Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
Science does not give us absolute and final certainty. It only gives us assurance within the limits of our mental abilities and the prevailing state of scientific thought.,Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig von Mises,"['praxeology', 'science']"
Most actions do not aim at anybody’s defeat or loss. They aim at an improvement in conditions.,Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig von Mises,"['economics', 'mises']"
"Ali major social entities such as nations, linguistic groups, rehgious communities, party organizations have been elevated to the dignity of the supreme collective that overshadows ali other collectives and claims the submission of the whole personality of ali rightthinking men. But an individual can renounce autonomous action and unconditionally surrender his self only in favor of one collective. Which collective this ought to be can be determined only by a quite arbitrary decision. The collective creed is by necessity exclusive and totalitarian. It craves the whole man and does not want to share him with any other collective. It seeks to establish the exclusive supreme validity of only one system of values.",Theory and History: An Interpretation of Social and Economic Evolution,Ludwig von Mises,[]

The task of the sciences of human action is the comprehension of the meaning and relevance of human action. They apply for this purpose two different epistemological procedures: conception and understanding. Conception is the mental tool of praxeology; understanding is the specific mental tool of history.,Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
"Human action is purposeful behavior. Or we may say: Action is will put into operation and transformed into an agency, is aiming at ends and goals, is the ego's meaningful response to stimuli and to the conditions of its environment, is a person's conscious adjustment to the state of the universe that determines his life.",Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig von Mises,"['acting-man', 'anarchism', 'capitalism', 'libertarianism']"

"Conversation with them turns only upon women, food, and (in the rainy season) the crops.",Human Action: A Treatise On Economics,Ludwig von Mises,[]
"That there are nations, states, and churches, that there is social cooperation under the division of labor, becomes discernible only in the actions of certain individuals. Nobody ever perceived a nation without perceiving its members. In this sense one may say that a social collective comes into being through the actions of individuals. That does not mean that the individual is temporally antecedent. It merely means that definite actions of individuals constitute the collective.",Human Action: A Treatise on Economics,Ludwig von Mises,"['economics', 'individualism', 'praxeology']"

panmechanistic world view is committed to a methodological monism; it acknowledges only mechanistic causality because it attributes to it alone any cognitive value or at least a higher cognitive value than to teleology.,Human Action,Ludwig von Mises,[]
