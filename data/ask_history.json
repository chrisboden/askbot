There\u2019s a much-downloaded PowerPoint presentation given to all new employees. But the truth is, it wasn\u2019t the product of meetings or careful planning or roundtable discussions.

The more a person uses Netflix, the better Netflix gets at providing exactly what that person wants. And increasingly, what people want is the original content that is exclusive to Netflix.

Moore\u2019s Law has worked its magic many other times, enabling new technologies ranging from computer animation (Pixar) to online file storage (Dropbox) to smartphones (Apple).
