"But in my experience, there is one way to signal your commitment to process that all negotiations provide: Always keep your word, even when it is costly. The best deal makers and diplomats take very seriously the promises and commitments they have made to the other side on small things and big. This is not only the right thing to do; it is a tremendously powerful instrument in deal making. Especially in difficult, protracted conflicts where negotiating itself might be seen as risky or useless, often the only source of leverage you have for bringing the other side to the table is your credibility. And once you’re at the table, mistrust is often the biggest barrier to the give-and-take necessary for progress, because many of the concessions either side commits to are not deliverable right away—promises of equitable treatment, power sharing, future benefits, etc. are necessarily premised on trust. If you have not built up a reputation for credibility, you are ill-suited to negotiate such deals.",Negotiating the Impossible: How to Break Deadlocks and Resolve Ugly Conflicts,Deepak Malhotra,[]

"But progress in the current negotiation is not the only potential victim of short-termism. A myopic approach to negotiating, even if a deal is reached, can exacerbate the likelihood of future conflict, or diminish our ability to resolve it.",Negotiating the Impossible: How to Break Deadlocks and Resolve Ugly Conflicts,Deepak Malhotra,[]

"Instead, the key is to focus on the principles. The principles are fewer and are broadly applicable. These include many of the ideas we have considered throughout the book—for example: control the frame, be mindful of the optics, help the other side save face, have a process strategy, negotiate process before substance, normalize the process, lower the bar for progress, stay at the table, empathize, create slack, work the whole body, map out the negotiation space, seek greater understanding, create value, and so on.",Negotiating the Impossible: How to Break Deadlocks and Resolve Ugly Conflicts,Deepak Malhotra,[]
"Imagine that you are on the street and someone attacks you. If you feel that you must fight back to defend yourself, you might instinctively make a fist and punch at the attacker’s head. In the heat of the moment, you might try to do this over and over again, using one instrument against one target. While natural, this may not be the most effective approach, especially against a competent attacker. Rather, you want to “work the whole body.” Instead of focusing narrowly on one target, or using only one method of attack, more experienced fighters will consider all of their instruments (two hands, two feet, knees, elbows, nearby items that can be used for defense, and so on) and evaluate all potential areas that could be targeted.",Negotiating the impossible: how to break deadlocks and resolve ugly conflicts,Deepak Malhotra,"['attack', 'competent', 'defend', 'defense', 'effective', 'fight', 'instrument', 'punch', 'target']"

"Yielding is a principle that is often discussed in the martial arts: the idea is that there can be tremendous power in going with—and perhaps redirecting—rather than resisting the energy or attack that is coming your way. Likewise, in negotiations, yielding means “going with,” and not “giving in.” Doing so effectively requires a clear and unbiased understanding of how the other side views the situation, and of the metrics they will use to evaluate ideas and options. Sometimes the best response to a deep-rooted perspective is to yield to it: understand it, adopt it, and repurpose it to advance your position.",Negotiating the impossible: how to break deadlocks and resolve ugly conflicts,Deepak Malhotra,"['attack', 'energy', 'give-in', 'go-with', 'position', 'power', 'repurpose', 'yield']"
