"Barry Schwartz points out in his book, The Paradox of Choice, that this kind of sheep-in-wolf’s-clothing decision is more likely to come up the more options you have to choose from. The greater the number of available options, the greater the likelihood that more than one of those options will look pretty good to you. The more options that look pretty good to you, the more time you spend in analysis paralysis. That’s the paradox: more choice, more anxiety. Remember, if the only choices are between Paris and a trout cannery, no one has a problem. But what if the choices are Paris or Rome or Amsterdam or Santorini or Machu Picchu? You get the picture. THE ONLY-OPTION TEST For any options you’re considering, ask yourself, “If this were the only option I had, would I be happy with it?” A useful tool you can use to break the gridlock is the Only-Option Test. If this were the only thing I could order on the menu . . . If this were the only show I could watch on Netflix tonight . . . If this were the only place I could go for vacation . . . If this were the only college I got accepted to . . . If this were the only house I could buy . . . If this were the only job I got offered . . . The Only-Option Test clears away the debris cluttering your decision. If you’d be happy if Paris were your only option, and you’d be happy if Rome were your only option, that reveals that if you just flip a coin, you’ll be happy whichever way the coin lands.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"And this feeling that the result of the decision tells you something significant about the quality of the decision process is so powerful that even when the description of the decision is identical (you quit your job and take a new position), your view of that decision changes as the quality of the result changes.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"For reasons that are going to become clear, a good decision tool seeks to reduce the role of cognitive bias (such as overconfidence, hindsight bias, or confirmation bias) and a pros and cons list tends to amplify the role of bias.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"Determining whether a decision is good or bad means examining the quality of the beliefs informing the decision, the available options, and how the future might turn out given any choice you make.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"There’s a name for this: Resulting. When people result, they look at whether the result was good or bad to figure out if the decision was good or bad. (Psychologists",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"When the outcome turns out poorly, it’s easy to focus on the details that suggest the decision process was poor. We think we are seeing the decision quality rationally because the bad process is obvious.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
The quality of the outcome casts a shadow over our ability to see the quality of the decision.,How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
We want outcome quality to align with decision quality.,How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
The decision you make determines which set of outcomes are possible and how likely each of those outcomes is. But it doesn’t determine which of that set of outcomes will actually happen.,How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"Luck is what intervenes between your decision (which has a range of possible outcomes) and the outcome that you actually get. Because any decision determines only the set of possible outcomes (some good, some bad, some in between), this means good outcomes can result from both good and bad",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
The actual outcome casts a shadow over your ability to remember what you knew at the time of the decision.,How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"HINDSIGHT BIAS The tendency to believe an event, after it occurs, was predictable or inevitable. It’s also been referred to as “knew-it-all-along” thinking or “creeping determinism.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
Memory creep is the reconstruction of your memory of what you knew that hindsight bias creates. MEMORY CREEP When what you know after the fact creeps into your memory of what you knew before the fact.,How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"Stuff you knew before the decision: The sum of your knowledge and beliefs at the time of the decision. For our purposes here, specifically the stuff you brought to bear on making the decision. Stuff you know after the outcome: This includes all the stuff you knew before the decision and new stuff that you learned after making the decision. For our purposes here, we’re focusing on new information that revealed itself after the future unfolded however it did. Using a Knowledge Tracker reduces hindsight bias by clarifying what you did and didn’t know at the time of the decision. Detailing what you knew and when you knew it helps prevent stuff that revealed itself after the fact from reflexively creeping into the before-the-fact box.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
Luck exerts its influence between your decision and which of the possible paths you end up on. It is the element you have no control over that determines which of the possible outcomes you actually observe in the short run.,How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,"['control', 'decision', 'influence', 'outcome', 'path']"
"In order to become a better decision-maker, it’s imperative to actively explore all four of the ways that decision quality and outcome quality relate to each other.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
Small changes in how much you notice the luck that you would otherwise overlook will have a big influence on the way your life turns out. Those small changes act like compounding interest that pays big dividends on your future decision-making.,How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"Even when you make a good decision, that doesn’t mean that it was the best decision. In fact, it rarely is. Striving to improve means being willing to fight the complacency that can come from a good decision leading to a good result.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"These exercises were designed to get you thinking about the following concepts: Resulting is the tendency to look at whether a result was good or bad to figure out whether a decision was good or bad. Outcomes cast a shadow over the decision process, leading you to overlook or distort information about the process, making your view of decision quality fit with outcome quality. In the short-term, for any single decision, there is only a loose relationship between the quality of the decision and the quality of the outcome. The two are correlated, but the relationship can take a long time to play out. Luck is what intervenes between your decision and the actual outcome. Resulting diminishes your view of the role of luck. You can’t tell that much about the quality of a decision from a single outcome, because of luck. When you make a decision, you can rarely guarantee a good outcome (or a bad one). Instead, the goal is to try to choose the option that will lead to the most favorable range of outcomes. Making better decisions starts with learning from experience. Resulting interferes with that learning, causing you to repeat some low-quality decisions and stop making some high-quality decisions. It also keeps you from examining good-quality/good-outcome decisions (as well as bad-quality/bad-outcome decisions), which still offer valuable lessons for future decisions. Resulting reduces compassion when it comes to how we treat others and ourselves.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"RESULTING CHECKLIST ☐ How much is the outcome clouding your judgment (or someone’s judgment you’ve observed) about the quality of the decision? ☐ Even if bad decisions preceded a bad outcome, can you identify some good decisions made along the way? Can you identify some ways in which the process of coming to the decision was good? ☐ Even if good decisions preceded a good outcome, can you identify some ways the decision could have been better? Can you identify some ways in which the process of coming to the decision could be improved? ☐ What are the factors outside the control of the decision-maker (who might be you), including the actions of other people? ☐ What are the other ways things could have turned out?",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
what you value and what someone else values will be different. And your goals and values will inform your preferences for various outcomes. That means that how much you prefer a particular outcome relative to other possibilities will naturally be different from another person’s preference for the same outcome relative to other possibilities.,How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"When people result, they look at whether the result was good or bad to figure out if the decision was good or bad.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
RESULTING A mental shortcut in which we use the quality of an outcome to figure out the quality of a decision.,How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
A necessary part of becoming a better decision-maker is learning from experience. Experience contains the lessons for improving future decisions. Resulting causes you to learn the wrong lessons.,How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"Experience is supposed to be our best teacher, but sometimes we draw a connection between outcome quality and decision quality that is too tight.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"Left to our own devices, we will notice some of the bad luck but overlook most of the dumb luck.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
Experience is necessary for learning. But we process that experience in a biased way. This means that the very feedback you need to become a better decision-maker can interfere with your ability to learn good lessons from experience.,How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"A lot of experience can be an excellent teacher. A single experience, not so much. Looking across a large enough set of decisions and outcomes, we can start to tease out the lessons experience might offer us. Looking at just one outcome, we get resulting and hindsight bias.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"We process outcomes sequentially, treating each outcome as if it stands alone. We don’t sit back and wait to update our beliefs until we have enough data to overcome the uncertain relationship between outcomes and decisions.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"Most decisions have a mix of upside and downside potentials. When figuring out whether a decision is good or bad, you are essentially asking if the upside potential compensates for the risk of the downside.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
"For any single decision, there are different ways the future could unfold—some better, some worse. When you make a decision, the decision makes certain paths possible (even if you don’t know where they lead) and others impossible. The decision you make determines which set of outcomes are possible and how likely each of those outcomes is. But it doesn’t determine which of that set of outcomes will actually happen.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,"['decision', 'future', 'outcome']"
"If you had a navigation app for your goals and decisions, it would work like a premortem and a backcast and its output would look like the Decision Exploration Table. You’ve identified two broad categories of future events (those within and outside your control) that could decrease or increase your chances of failure or success and made an educated guess about their likelihood. You now have a good map of what might lie in the path on the way to your goal.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,"['control', 'decision', 'goal', 'navigation', 'path']"
"An accurate picture of the odds is important when you’re choosing a path. But once you’ve already made your choice, then you should switch into irrational optimism for the execution phase.",How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,"['choice', 'execution', 'irrational', 'odd', 'optimism', 'path']"
there are only two things that determine how your life turns out: luck and the quality of your decisions. You have control over only one of those two things.,How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices,Annie Duke,[]
