"The collapse, for example, of IBM’s legendary 80-year-old hardware business in the 1990s sounds like a classic P-type story. New technology (personal computers) displaces old (mainframes) and wipes out incumbent (IBM). But it wasn’t. IBM, unlike all its mainframe competitors, mastered the new technology. Within three years of launching its first PC, in 1981, IBM achieved $5 billion in sales and the #1 position, with everyone else either far behind or out of the business entirely (Apple, Tandy, Commodore, DEC, Honeywell, Sperry, etc.). For decades, IBM dominated computers like Pan Am dominated international travel. Its $13 billion in sales in 1981 was more than its next seven competitors combined (the computer industry was referred to as “IBM and the Seven Dwarfs”). IBM jumped on the new PC like Trippe jumped on the new jet engines. IBM owned the computer world, so it outsourced two of the PC components, software and microprocessors, to two tiny companies: Microsoft and Intel. Microsoft had all of 32 employees. Intel desperately needed a cash infusion to survive. IBM soon discovered, however, that individual buyers care more about exchanging files with friends than the brand of their box. And to exchange files easily, what matters is the software and the microprocessor inside that box, not the logo of the company that assembled the box. IBM missed an S-type shift—a change in what customers care about. PC clones using Intel chips and Microsoft software drained IBM’s market share. In 1993, IBM lost $8.1 billion, its largest-ever loss. That year it let go over 100,000 employees, the largest layoff in corporate history. Ten years later, IBM sold what was left of its PC business to Lenovo. Today, the combined market value of Microsoft and Intel, the two tiny vendors IBM hired, is close to $1.5 trillion, more than ten times the value of IBM. IBM correctly anticipated a P-type loonshot and won the battle. But it missed a critical S-type loonshot, a software standard, and lost the war.","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]
"Let’s call it the Moses Trap: When ideas advance only at the pleasure of a holy leader—rather than the balanced exchange of ideas and feedback between soldiers in the field and creatives at the bench selecting loonshots on merit—that is exactly when teams and companies get trapped. The leader raises his staff and parts the seas to make way for the chosen loonshot. The dangerous virtuous cycle spins faster and faster: loonshot feeds franchise feeds bigger, faster, more. The all-powerful leader begins acting for love of loonshots rather than strength of strategy. And then the wheel turns one too many times.","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]

"Peter Thiel and Ken Howery at Founders Fund, however, reached out to their friends behind the scenes at Friendster. They dug into why users were leaving the site. Like other users, Thiel and Howery knew that Friendster crashed often. They also knew that the team behind Friendster had received, and ignored, crucial advice on how to scale their site—how to transform a system built for a few thousand users into one that could support millions of users. They asked for and received a copy of Friendster’s data on user retention. They were stunned by how long users stayed with the site, despite the irritating crashes. They concluded that users weren’t leaving because social networks were weak business models, like clothing brands. They were leaving because of a software glitch. It was a False Fail.

"On the creative side, inventors (artists) often believe that their work should speak for itself. Most find any kind of promotion distasteful. On the business side, line managers (soldiers) don’t see the need for someone who doesn’t make or sell stuff—for someone whose job is simply to promote an idea internally. But great project champions are much more than promoters.

"By 1938, Hitler had annexed Austria and the Sudetenland; Franco and his Nationalists had captured most of Spain; Mussolini was in full control of Italy; and Japan had invaded China and captured Beijing.

"Evaluating decisions and outcomes separately is equally important in the opposite case: bad decisions may occasionally result in good outcomes. You may have a flawed strategy, but your opponent made an unforced error, so you won anyway. You kicked the ball weakly toward the goalkeeper, but he slipped on some mud, and you scored. Which is why probing wins, critically, is as important, if not more so, as probing losses. Failing to analyze wins can reinforce a bad process or strategy. You may not be lucky next time. You don’t want to be the person who makes a poor investment, gets lucky because of a bubble, concludes he is an investment genius, bets his fortune, and then loses it all next time around.","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]

"One of the reasons that crazy projects like the Red Balloon Challenge can succeed inside DARPA is that there is no career ladder.

Some of the loudest complaints came from startups—Texas Air, Braniff, and, eventually, Southwest Airlines. The startups also brought new ideas to the industry. Hub and spoke. Flying to secondary airports. Reducing turnaround times to 20 minutes. Like Sam Walton’s supersized stores far outside cities, none of the ideas involved new technologies.

"As NeXT began to struggle, even as Jobs’s star was rising, several employees at NeXT, as well as executives from Compaq and Dell, approached Jobs with an idea: get out of hardware. NeXT’s software was excellent. Its graphical interface and programming tools were more elegant and powerful than Microsoft’s DOS and early Windows. Jobs could offer PC makers an alternative to Microsoft, which they desperately wanted. In return, the PC makers could offer NeXT something it desperately needed: a future. The idea of switching from hardware to software was a classic S-type loonshot. Jobs had risen to fame selling hardware. Bigger, faster, more, every year. The stars of the day—IBM, DEC, Compaq, Dell—sold shiny machines stamped with their famous logos.

In fact, Jobs had already doubled down. Not long after he left Apple, Jobs got back in touch with the team of engineers in Marin County developing a graphics computer. Why bet on just one bigger, faster machine if you could have two? He bought their business and left them alone to build an even more powerful computer than NeXT.

"Here is Catmull describing the need to maintain the balance between loonshots and franchises—“the Beast”—in film: Originality is fragile. And, in its first moments, it’s often far from pretty. This is why I call early mock-ups of our films “Ugly Babies.” They are not beautiful, miniature versions of the adults they will grow up to be. They are truly ugly: awkward and unformed, vulnerable and incomplete. They need nurturing—in the form of time and patience—in order to grow. What this means is that they have a hard time coexisting with the Beast.… When I talk about the Beast and the Baby, it can seem very black and white—that the Beast is all bad and the Baby is all good. The truth is, reality lies somewhere in between. The Beast is a glutton but also a valuable motivator. The Baby is so pure and unsullied, so full of potential, but it’s also needy and unpredictable and can keep you up at night. The key is for your Beast and your Babies to coexist peacefully, and that requires that you keep various forces in balance.","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]

Teams with a system mindset, level 2, probe the decision-making process behind a failure. How did we arrive at that decision?

It was a strategy that had been rejected by nearly all others in the industry: a closed ecosystem. Many companies had tried, and failed, to impose a closed ecosystem on customers. IBM built a personal computer with a proprietary operating system called OS/2. Both the computer and the operating system disappeared. Analysts, observers, and industry experts concluded that a closed ecosystem could never work: customers wanted choice. Apple, while Jobs was exiled to NeXT, followed the advice of the analysts and experts. It opened its system, licensing out Macintosh software and architecture. Clones proliferated, just like Windows-based PCs. When Jobs returned to Apple, he insisted that the board agree to shut down the clones. It cost Apple over $100 million to cancel existing contracts at a time when it was desperately fighting bankruptcy. But that S-type loonshot, closing the ecosystem, drove the phenomenal rise of Apple’s products.

He had separated his phases: the studio of Jony Ive, Apple’s chief product designer, who reported only to Jobs, became “as off-limits as Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project.” He had learned to love both artists and soldiers: it was Tim Cook who was groomed to succeed him as CEO.

"One of the things that distinguishes an emergent property like the flow of liquids from a fundamental law—like quantum mechanics or gravity, for example—is that an emergent property can suddenly change.

Small disruptions grow exponentially. That’s a jammed flow state. The sudden change between smooth and jammed flow is a phase transition.","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]
"To understand what phase transitions tell us about nurturing loonshots more effectively, we need to know just two things about them: 1. At the heart of every phase transition is a tug-of-war between two competing forces. 2. Phase transitions are triggered when small shifts in system properties—for example, density or temperature—cause the balance between those two forces to change.

"In the next chapter, I will show you that team size plays the same role in organizations that temperature does for liquids and solids. As team size crosses a “magic number,” the balance of incentives shifts from encouraging a focus on loonshots to a focus on careers. The magic number is not universal, however. Teams transform at different sizes, just like solids melt at different temperatures. The reason is the key idea behind our fourth rule. It’s why we can change the magic number.

"Imagine bringing that bathtub to the brink of freezing. A little bit one way or the other and the whole thing freezes or liquefies. But right on the cusp, blocks of ice coexist with pockets of liquid. The coexistence of two phases, on the edge of a phase transition, is called phase separation. The phases break apart—but stay connected. The connection between the two phases takes the form of a balanced cycling back and forth: Molecules in ice patches melt into adjacent pools of liquid. Molecules of liquid swimming by an ice patch lock onto a surface and freeze. That cycling, in which neither phase overwhelms the other, is called dynamic equilibrium.

"Trippe’s strategy of nurturing P-type loonshots and betting on bigger, faster, more—with a dash of marketing glamour—worked brilliantly. Technology improvements lowered costs, providing more money to invest in more technology improvements. Larger planes flew more customers farther, faster. That virtuous cycle continuously grew his franchise, propelling Trippe far ahead of competitors, attracting fame and celebrity, just as a similar virtuous cycle would propel leading technology companies for the rest of the century, from Polaroid to IBM and Apple. P-type loonshots feed a growing franchise, which feeds more P-type loonshots.

The sudden change in traffic flow falls within a second category of phase transition called a dynamic instability.,"Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]

"In 1957, a pair of British mathematicians identified a new category of phase transition. It has helped us understand the spread of forest fires, predict the formation of oil deposits, and, most recently, anticipate, and possibly prevent, terror attacks","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]
"Broadbent and Hammersley discovered that the answer to both the gas-mask puzzle and the forest-fire puzzle was described by a phase transition. Below a threshold density of pores in a gas mask, no air could get through. Above that critical density, a channel would always appear connecting one side to the other. For forests, below a threshold density of trees, the fire would die out. Above that critical density, the fire would engulf the whole forest.","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]
"tree density is not the only control parameter. Just as with cars on a highway, the forest-fire transition has more than one. Suppose wind is blowing strongly. Realistically, sparks could spread farther than just one tree. At high wind speeds, therefore, the contagion threshold should take place at a lower density of trees.","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]
"Air finding a channel through pores in a mask or fire finding a path through trees in a forest reminded Hammersley of water percolating through coffee grounds. If the grounds are packed too tightly, water may not find a path through. When they are loose enough: drip, drip. So Hammersley called his techniques and ideas “percolation theory.” Like symmetry-breaking, percolation theory turns out to connect a staggering range of seemingly unrelated systems.","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]
"When should you drill for oil? Fissures deep in the ground form randomly, like pores in the gas mask. Below the percolation threshold for those fissures, your drill will likely hit a small, disconnected cluster of trapped oil. Bad investment. Above the percolation threshold, your drill is likely to pierce one giant, connected reservoir of oil. Good investment.","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]
"The percolation models predict something you would never guess through intuition, or experience, or microsimulations with different tree types and vegetation. It is a unique prediction of the science of emergence and of phase transitions. According to these models, as a forest gets dangerously close to a phase transition, to erupting, the frequency of fires should take a specific form. The frequency should vary in inverse proportion to size: Twenty-acre fires should occur half as often as ten-acre fires. Forty-acre fires should occur one-quarter as often as ten-acre fires. Hundred-acre fires should occur one-tenth as often, and so on. That pattern, called a power law, is a surprising prediction—a mathematical clue that a forest is on the verge of erupting. The pattern has been seen elsewhere. As we will discuss below, the power-law pattern is seen not only in forest-fire models, but in financial markets and terrorist attacks.","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]
"The pattern of many connections within one tight community, punctuated by occasional ties to distant communities, describes a vast range of systems. Neurons in the brain mostly connect within one cluster, but occasionally their axons extend far outside, to an entirely different cluster. Proteins in a cell mostly interact within one functional group, but occasionally they connect with receptors far removed. Sites on the internet mostly connect within one tight group (celebrity news sites link to other celebrity news sites; biology sites link to other biology sites), but occasionally a site will connect far outside its cluster (TMZ will link to a study on neuroscience). The Kevin Bacon game had shown that there are surprisingly few steps between any two nodes (actors) in these kinds of networks. So Watts and Strogatz called a system with mostly local connections but occasional distant ties a “small-world network.","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]
"Allied shipping losses reached a staggering 7.8 million tons in 1942. By early 1943, food supplies to Britain had dwindled to two-thirds of normal levels. The government was forced to ration basic goods. Less than three months of commercial oil reserves remained—ten months, if all emergency military reserves were included. Oil supply was not publicly discussed, but every commander, on both sides of the Atlantic, paid close attention. No oil meant no planes, no ships, no transport.

"Johnson’s team identified similar control parameters for the virtual terror cells on the Russian website. The number of clusters was like the density of trees.

"The governor of Illinois feared that armed Mormon retaliation could escalate into a civil war. He urged Smith’s successor, Brigham Young, and his followers to leave the state.

How should you move thousands of families and their horses, mules, oxen, cows, sheep, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats, geese, and goats, all while searching for a permanent home? Young stewed on the problem, debated with his advisors, and finally, on January 14, 1847, announced that the Lord had spoken to him.

"The molecules of a liquid roam all over. Think of the water molecules in the tub as a platoon of cadets running randomly around a practice field. When the temperature drops below freezing, it’s as if a drill sergeant blew a whistle and the cadets suddenly snapped into formation. The rigid order of the solid repels the hammer. The chaotic disorder of the liquid lets it slip through. Systems snap when the tide turns in a microscopic tug-of-war. Binding forces try to lock water molecules into rigid formation. Entropy, the tendency of systems to become more disordered, encourages those molecules to roam. As temperature decreases, binding forces get stronger and entropy forces get weaker. When the strengths of those two forces cross, the system snaps. Water freezes.","Loonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries",Safi Bahcall,[]
"There are many reasons projects can die: funding dwindles, a competitor wins, the market changes, a key person leaves. But the False Fail is common to loonshots. Risks of this type of death can never be fully eliminated—negative results don’t come with a neon sign that lights up “your idea is flawed” or “your test is flawed.” But those risks can be reduced, which is exactly what Endo and Folkman did, as we will discuss below.

"The military, Bush knew, had been gearing up to produce more of the same: more planes, more ships, more guns. Like a large film studio churning out sequel after sequel, the military was operating in what we might call a franchise phase.* To invent the radically new technologies necessary to defeat the Germans, however, the military would need to operate in an entirely different phase, one that offered scientists and engineers, as Bush wrote, the “independence and opportunity to explore the bizarre.” In other words, Bush understood intuitively that being good at franchises and being good at loonshots are phases of organization.
