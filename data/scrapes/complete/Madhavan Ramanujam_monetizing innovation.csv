Companies with strong product-driven or engineering cultures tend to be the ones that develop feature shocks. Firms with a culture of playing it safe and avoiding big risks typically suffer minivations. Hidden gems most often afflict companies that coddle the core business. And undeads are born in firms whose top-down cultures discourage feedback and criticism from below.

"When most people hear the word “price,” they think of a number. That's a price point. When we use the term price, we are trying to get at something more fundamental. We want to understand the perceived value that the innovation holds for the customer.",Monetizing Innovation: How Smart Companies Design the Product Around the Price,Madhavan Ramanujam,[]
More specifically the typical process steps are as follows: Hypothesis development: Innovation teams start with identifying the white space. They ask questions like “Where can we create and deliver differentiated value?” and “Which markets are underserved?,Monetizing Innovation: How Smart Companies Design the Product Around the Price,Madhavan Ramanujam,[]
"Internal refinement: A cross-functional group of internal experts comes together to refine and pressure test the hypotheses. These discussions bring together teams like marketing, sales, pricing, and product design. Initial customer validation: The team then starts validating product-market fit, perceived value, and WTP with target markets. Methods used include value trade-offs, ideal package (i.e. product configuration) creation, unaided WTP, and purchase probability (as outlined in Chapter 4). This typically occurs prior to writing any code. The gut-check: The concept must then pass an internal “smell test.” The team typically pitches the product concept to LinkedIn",Monetizing Innovation: How Smart Companies Design the Product Around the Price,Madhavan Ramanujam,[]

"If you are losing a high percentage of deals or your sales greatly and consistently deviate from your target plan, or if the sales force complains that price is the only reason they're losing deals, you could have a sales training problem.

"By the way, be prepared to learn that your price might not be high enough. The number of escalated deals is an important KPI here. Having too few escalated deals could indicate the sales team is finding it too easy to sell. You need to ask yourself whether you priced your product high enough.",Monetizing Innovation: How Smart Companies Design the Product Around the Price,Madhavan Ramanujam,[]
"Price Wars: The Only Winning Move Is Not to Play Price wars are about seeing who can lower prices the most. You don't want to start one, and you don't want to be the first one to move. Ultimately, a price war has only one winner: the supplier with the lowest cost. Most likely, that's not you.",Monetizing Innovation: How Smart Companies Design the Product Around the Price,Madhavan Ramanujam,[]
price is both an indication of what customers value and a measure of how much they are willing to pay for that value. Porsche,Monetizing Innovation: How Smart Companies Design the Product Around the Price,Madhavan Ramanujam,[]

"It sounds easy, but consider this: You have thought about your innovation for months or even years. You know the product inside and out. However, a salesperson may only have 10 minutes with the customer. Your customer might stay on your website only for five minutes. An advertisement may only run for 15 seconds. That marketing message, that sales pitch, and that ad must clearly articulate the value to customers in a very short period of time. If they don't, the would-be customer tunes out.",Monetizing Innovation: How Smart Companies Design the Product Around the Price,Madhavan Ramanujam,[]

"Don't force a one-size-fits-all solution. Whether you like it or not, your customers are different, so customer segmentation is crucial.

"Have the “willingness to pay” talk with customers early in the product development process. If you don't do it early, you won't be able to prioritize the product features you develop, and you won't know whether you're building something customers will pay for until it's in the marketplace. Don't force a one-size-fits-all solution. Whether you like it or not, your customers are different, so customer segmentation is crucial. But segmentation based on demographics—the primary way companies group their customers—is misleading. You should build segments based on differences in your customers' willingness to pay for your new product. Product configuration and bundling is more science than art. You need to build them carefully and match them with your most meaningful segments. Choose the right pricing and revenue models, because how you charge is often more important than how much you charge. Develop your pricing strategy. Create a plan that looks a few steps ahead, allowing you to maximize gains in the short and long term. Draft your business case using customer willingness-to-pay data, and establish links between price, value, volume, and cost. Without this, your business case will tell you only what you want to hear, which may be far afield from market realities. Communicate the value of your offering clearly and compellingly; otherwise you will not get customers to pay full measure. Understand your customers' irrational sides, because whether you sell to other businesses or to consumers, your customers are people. You should take into account their full psyches, including their emotions, in making purchase decisions. Maintain your pricing integrity. Control discounting tightly. If demand for your new product is below expectations, only use price cuts as a last resort, after all other measures have been exhausted.
