"Choosing an Independent Board Member|Choosing Board Members|Your independent board members will typically be other operators or entrepreneurs with relevant functional experience (e.g., a former CFO) or industry experience. While some series A investors won't push for the independent seat to be filled for a while (or, in some cases, at all), others will push for a faster addition to the board. Please note: this will be one of the most important people you ""hire""--and it will be hard to remove a director once you add one. Proceed carefully and deliberately through these critical steps:
It bears repeating: this is one of the most important people you will hire. You should write up what you would optimally want in a board member by drafting a checklist or hiring spec. This should include:
Experience--which may include:
Depending on your existing board and experiences as a founder, you may or may not care about market experience, functional experience, or operating experience. Or you may be willing to trade these off, as it will be hard to find the perfect person.
Involvement with other high-growth companies (optimally as a founder). People who have not seen a company go from two people in a coffeehouse to a multi-thousand-person organization aren't used to all the bumps in the road that this entails. Things will always take longer and always be rougher than expected. Most startups face at least one moment, if not more, that feels like an existential crisis, where the company faces death from competition, excessive burn, government regulation, or other issues. And, unlike at a large established company, natural momentum won't necessarily exist. At an early-stage startup, each bit of execution is an act of sheer will, rather than an act of momentum. As your company matures, this will shift and eventually you may have too much momentum, with a large, difficult-to-steer ship of your own. This is of course many years down the line, and is in some sense a good problem to have. In the meantime, you need board members who understand this journey.
Optimally, if there is just one independent board slot, the independent board member would be a current or former entrepreneur. Other successful entrepreneurs will be able to relate more closely to a founder's emotional state and provide advice based on their own experiences. They will understand the ""newbie"" nature of being a founder/CEO and be open to answering ""stupid questions"" without condescension or judgment. They will have firsthand knowledge of how to build a business and understand that the bumps along the way are inevitable.
Finally, successful entrepreneurs can serve as a counterweight to the VC board members in a way that benefits the company, and hence also benefits the VC. If an entrepreneur board member is successful enough, the VC is unlikely to have much leverage over them--they already have lots of money, strong personal brands, and others who will work with them. The VC cannot exploit a power dynamic to force a truly independent board member to side with them on contentious board business.
Raw intelligence. This is self-explanatory. Some folks, such as Marc Andreessen, Reid Hoffman, Mike Moritz, and Vinod Khosla, are known for their raw intellectual horsepower. Notably, the former two took board seats or made investments prior to becoming full-time VCs.
Business and strategic sensibility. Ultimately a high-growth company board will face a number of core business and strategic questions. Will they help you navigate the strategic landscape, understand how to use M&A at scale as a tool, or have deep insights into product pricing or other aspects of running a business? Many founder CEOs also need input into team management and operations that a business-savvy independent may provide.
Entrepreneur-friendly orientation. A number of VCs will suggest a ""friend of the (venture) firm"" as your independent board member. These people will often owe the VC more than they will ever owe your company, and when shit hits the fan they'll vote with the VC. In other words, the ""independent"" board seat will in reality be an investor board seat, and you will lose control of the company (see ""Avoiding a VC crony"" below). To avoid this, you ideally want an independent board member who is sympathetic to your aims as an entrepreneur, not just to the VCs' fiduciary duties.
On the other hand, you do want to find someone the VC respects and will listen to. Optimally, the entire venture firm that backed you knows this potential independent board member. The best scenario is to find someone that your VC respects, but who you know is an entrepreneur at heart or who will at least be more entrepreneur- friendly. In the best case, you will have a preexisting, long-term relationship with this person, which will help you trust each other when the company inevitably hits a hard spot.
Respect of investors/VCs.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Choosing an Independent Board Member|Choosing Board Members|Part of the independent board member's role will be to remind VC board members that they should be voting in the company's best interest (rather than each investor's own best interest). He or she should have the confidence and insight to push back on the VCs when it makes sense to do so. The independent should help keep the VCs ""honest."" This does not mean the independent should rubber stamp the founder's every whim. Rather, he or she is there to do what is best for the company and to remind the VC members that their purpose should be the same.
This is easiest to accomplish if both the VC and the founder respect the independent board member. Both of you should spend a lot of time with candidates for your board before adding them.
Once you have defined what you want, discuss it with your investors and get agreement on the spec. This helps you call bullshit on them (e.g., when they offer up a friend of the firm with no relevant background) and lets them call bullshit on you and keep you honest (e.g., when you suggest your best friend from high school).
Make a prioritized list of people you would most like to add to the board. You can use an executive search firm which specializes in board members or ask your investors, advisors, or other entrepreneurs for suggestions. Your board members are optimally people that you wish you could hire for the company, that are truly out of reach otherwise.
""Your board members are optimally people that you wish you could hire for the company, that are truly out of reach otherwise.""
- Elad Gil
You will get a lot of pressure from your investors to finalize the board, but don't be afraid to push back and make sure you take the time (many months) to find the right person. You would not rush to hire a crappy engineer ""just to fill the spot."" With a board member (who will be more of a pain than a bad employee) this becomes even more important.
Have some questions and topics ready to discuss with potential board members:
This is really important. You as the founder(s) should have great personal rapport with the independent board member. He or she should be someone you feel you can trust--who you would feel good about calling at midnight on a Friday--and someone you think will be able to help you grow the company and, ideally, grow personally. This board member should be someone who, if circumstances were different, you would be excited to start a company with.
When assessing a potential board member's attitude, there are a few things to avoid:
Does the independent board member understand where you want to take the business? Is he or she aligned with that vision and direction? You want someone who will support that vision rather than second-guess it. Similarly, you want someone who will take a long-term view to building a great company (assuming that is your intent), rather than focus on a short-term flip.
Look at prospective board members' backgrounds: What has happened to the companies they have started or run? Did they sell early, and if so why? What other choices have they made in their careers, and how thoughtful are they in hindsight about those decisions?
What do people who have worked with your prospective board members think of them? Are they high integrity? What are they helpful at? If they are already on boards, what do the entrepreneurs they work with think of them?
Optimally you will take a ""common nominates, preferred stock approves"" approach to adding the independent board member. Just like with the Supreme Court--where the president nominates the justices and Congress approves the nominations--the balance of power lies with the nominator (thanks to Naval Ravikant for this analogy). Your VCs may have some great suggestions for board members (and you should definitely ask for their opinion). But ultimately you want to be driving the final ""election,"" and to do that, your biggest point of leverage is in who you nominate.
Like any other member of your team, the independent board member may eventually lose their usefulness beyond a certain scale of company. A public company board tends to look and act differently from an early stage startup board. If you control the independent seat, you may want to change people out if their skills and insights lose relevance.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Removing members from your board|Removing board members|Unfortunately, there are times when things just don't work out with a board member. This could range from board members being benign but useless (e.g., spouting generic advice that does not matter) to being actively destructive. I have heard of board members leaking information to the press, fomenting political factions among the staff under the CEO, derailing a company's financings, or pushing for strategic directions that make no sense. I have seen cofounders leave more than one company due to poor advice from board members, as well as board members who poach executives from one startup to join another of their portfolio companies.
While it is typically straightforward to remove a misbehaving employee, a poorly behaved board member may be harder to ""divorce."" In general, investor board members are harder to remove than independents.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Removing members from your board|Removing VC board members|Once they join your board as part of a financing, investor board members are notoriously hard to get rid of, as they usually have contractual rights to the board seat written in their financing documents (i.e., your series A, or series B, C, etc., paperwork). 1
Removing a VC board member can generally only happen at a time of transition or leverage (a financing event, major change in company direction, IPO, etc). Additionally, the VC may have extra economics in the investment for taking the board seat, or view the seat as something that builds her stature in the broader world. So how do you get rid of a misbehaving board member? There are a few tactics you can try, depending on the stage of your company, the leverage you have as an entrepreneur, and your relationship to the VC and her firm.
1. Change the overall composition of the board to reflect the maturation of the company (and boot the VC off as part of this shift). The makeup of your board should change as the company scales from a young organization seeking to develop a meaningful product to a more mature startup in high-growth mode. At the early stages, board members may be valuable in your quest for product/market fit or your next round of funding. For example, board members may know of new distribution tactics or other strategies that are working in their portfolios, which they can share with you (e.g., ""Facebook is suddenly working well for mobile app distribution""). However, if they lack operating experience, a network of potential later-stage executive hires, or broader strategic insights, it might make sense to replace them and other board members as your company starts to scale rapidly.
Once a company finds product/market fit and focuses on scaling, the skill set, network, and advice needed from a board member shifts as well. Similarly, as a company starts to plan to go public it will need to add more independent directors and more operators, as well as more specialized board members (e.g., a former CFO for the finance/audit committee).
""Once a company finds product/market fit and focuses on scaling, the skill set, network and advice needed from a board members shifts as well.""
- Elad Gil
When shifting into high-growth mode, you can ask multiple early board members to step off the board to help enable the transition to a successful later-stage or public company. This approach prevents any one request from being viewed as a personal criticism of any one board member--rather, you are changing the slate as the company matures. If an early board member can be especially helpful in your later stages, you can retain this board member or alternatively convert her to an independent seat.
While the request to step down as the company matures may be a logical one that should increase the value of the company overall, some may refuse--because they benefit from the stature of being on your board, for example, or want to protect their investment in your company until the company has a liquidity event. But if one or more of the other board members step down as part of an overall reshuffle, it puts pressure on the holdouts to comply as well.
Alternatively, as a later-stage funding round occurs you can ask an early investor to step down so that you can create a seat for a later-stage investor. Many early-stage investors may refuse. However, you can point out that the investor coming in brings new and necessary skills, networks, or advice to the table. Remind existing members that there is a need to keep the board to a constrained size and also to start planning toward an IPO (assuming one is in sight in 18 months or less).
In general, simply asking an investor board member to step down is unlikely to work.
2. Buy them out. It takes 5-10 years for most companies to have a liquidity event. Many investors will be raising additional funds from their own limited partners (LPs) along the way, and they'll want to show a return to get the LPs to invest more in those future funds. This means you can offer VC board members an opportunity to sell a subset of their stake in your company in exchange for stepping off the board. This stock sale could happen either via a secondary event (see the chapter on late-stage financings) or as part of a later-stage primary funding round. If the investor does want to sell stock prior to a full liquidity event such as an IPO, you can make the following arguments for why a stock sale should be tied to her stepping off the board:
3. Ask the VC firm to swap out your board member for another partner from their firm. This tends to work only if your company is working really well and the firm wants to maintain a positive relationship with you over time as the founder of a breakout company. Unless the VC partner you are trying to remove controls the whole firm, the firm may agree to swap out your board member for another one to maintain warm ties with you. (Thanks to Reid Hoffman for this insight.)
These conversations, by the way, can be very tough and very emotional. VC board members are humans too, and they may have a lot of ego or emotion wrapped up in a successful company. Even if they have done nothing to help the company beyond capital (and capital is indeed helpful), your VCs may still feel that they fundamentally contributed to the company's success. When making your case that they should step down, be firm, calm, and consistent.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Removing members from your board|Removing independent board members|Independent directors are generally easier to remove than investor board members. In some cases, you control the independent board seat and can simply ask the board member to step down (see below on ""Independent board seat structures""). The simplest way is to explain why you want them to do so. Obviously, though, there are lots of reasons (ego, a difference of opinion, VC investor influence, etc.) that board members may not be willing to step down.
There are two types of independent board members: those whose primary relationship is to you, and those whose primary relationship (and sense of loyalty) is to the VC who invested in your company and helped bring them on board. The VC Crony probably owes a lot more to the VC than they do to you. Additionally, they will have a tendency to vote the way the VC wants or push for things the VC asks them to push for.
These VC Crony independents may be harder to remove, as your investor board members will have a disincentive to support their replacement on the board. In some cases you may need to negotiate with the VC directly for the removal of the independent. Alternatively, if you have a larger board with many members, they can help push for the removal of a non-performing independent.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil

"The role of the CEO: Managing your board of directors|Board meeting structure|Your board meeting structure 1 is likely to change over the course of the company's evolution, as you move from an early-stage venture struggling for product/market fit 2 to a more mature organization preparing to go public. For an early-stage company, board meetings may be primarily about reviewing a handful of fundamental metrics (e.g., ""Are we running out of money?"" and, ""is our product working?"") as well as broader strategic input, organizational advice, and hiring help for the CEO and executive team. Later-stage board meetings tend to broaden to include advanced strategy questions (e.g., M&A and other conversations).
The larger the board is the harder it will be to manage it and keep it both focused and productive. Just as scaling your team from 10 to 10,000 people changes how you communicate with and manage them, growing the board also changes the conversations and communication styles you need to use at the board level. The hard part is ensuring that meetings remain productive and useful for the company.
Remember, board meetings exist to (1) help the company and (2) provide proper corporate governance for all classes of stock.
In order to make a board meeting effective, the CEO should try to do the following prior to the meeting:
1. Send out the board deck and other materials at least 48-72 hours before the meeting. You want people to have a chance to review it in advance. 3
2. [If you have three or more non-founder members only] Call board members in advance for a 30- to 60-minute 1:1 briefing. This allows board members to give input (and, in some cases, vent) in advance of the board meeting.
3. [If you have multiple board members only] Plan a board dinner the night before, or lunch/dinner right after. While optional, these dinners are an opportunity for board members to form bonds with one another and potentially with you and your team in advance/after the meeting.

"The role of the CEO: Managing your board of directors|Board meeting agenda|Once you're in the meeting proper, it will likely include the following items:4
1. Board business. This should be short. Get it out of the way quickly.
2. Big picture summary. A short, high-level overview of the state of company.
3. Quick review and discussion of key metrics. You'll want to pay particular attention to those metrics that impact company strategy. These metrics should all have been in the slides sent out 48-72 hours earlier.
4. Follow-up items from last meeting. You can also do this section after the strategy topics. Really what you want is a large block of time to focus on strategy.
5. Discussion of 2-3 key strategy topics important to company. These topics and background on them should have been in the slides sent out 48-72 hours earlier.
The bulk of your time should be spent on #5. Your board members should have reviewed the materials in advance. If you have a larger board, you should have called each member prior to the board meeting for a quick discussion/queue-up of the strategic topics. This allows you to avoid a long rehash of metrics and background that eat into the discussion time.

"The role of the CEO: Managing your board of directors|Board observers and random people showing up to board meetings|Some venture firms will ask more junior members of their investment teams to show up along with them at board meetings. Or, they may bring more senior partners to sit in if your company is doing well. Don't tolerate random people showing up. A board meeting is not open to whoever the venture firm wants to include. If the firm wants an additional member to attend--e.g., a junior partner who can help with follow-up for your company (and these people can occasionally be quite helpful)--negotiate parameters with your VC partner.

"Recruiting, hiring and managing talent|Recruiting best practices|One of the biggest challenges a company faces as it scales is to revamp its recruiting and employee onboarding processes. When Twitter bought my startup it had just 90 employees. By the time I left two and half years later, Twitter had grown to close to 1,500 people--93% of the employees were new.
In order to add 500 people a year you need to change the way you approach and scale your recruiting organization, you need to think deeply about employee onboarding, and you need to maintain and evolve your culture. In this chapter we cover these and other shifts required to hire and manage talent. As you scale from hiring 10 people a year to 10 people a week, a small number of recruiting processes can go a long way in maintaining a high bar and expediting key hires.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Recruiting, hiring and managing talent|Write a job description for every role|Many companies start off recruiting via personal networks for a small number of roles--e.g., engineers and designers. As a company scales beyond individual contributors in a handful of functions, it is important for people hiring for a role to understand what is important in the person they hire. For example, if you are hiring a business development person for the first time (see ""how to hire great BD people,""), what should people look for in that person and role? An engineer on the interview panel might not know the difference between a business development and a sales person. Clarifying skill set and role is important so everyone is looking for the same type of candidate.
For each role you should write a job description that explains what the role will do, and what experience and background you are looking for. You can also the list the things you are not looking for, or consider less important. This description should be circulated to people interviewing for the role with a short note explaining what the hiring manager is looking for and prioritizing. If your team subsequently raises questions about who to hire for the role, you can refer back to the original job description to correct any bad assumptions.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Recruiting, hiring and managing talent|Ask every candidate the same questions|For each candidate for a given role, ask the same or similar interview questions. This will allow you to calibrate candidates across identical questions.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Recruiting, hiring and managing talent|Assign focus areas to the interviewers prior to the interview|Often you want to interview candidates for specific aspects of their role. For example, you might interview a product manager on their product insights, past accomplishments, culture fit, etc. Rather than have every person the candidate interviews with ask the same set of questions for every area, you could have three or four interviewers each focus on a different area that you assign to them before the interview. This will allow for an in-depth view of each area, versus a shallow view of all areas.
Additionally, if you bring the person back for a second round of interviews, you can double down on areas of concern with more focused interviews.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Recruiting, hiring and managing talent|Work product interviews|For some roles, the best way to assess a candidate (outside of direct prior knowledge working with them) is to have them develop a work product as part of the interview. This could happen either onsite or as a take home. For example, an engineer could do a coding exercise, or a designer could be asked to do a quick set of wire frames or workflow for a hypothetical product. A marketing person could be asked to generate a hypothetical product marketing plan. In general, it is good to avoid asking for work or output on an existing company product to avoid the perception of getting free labor out of a candidate.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Recruiting, hiring and managing talent|Candidate scoring|As each person finishes their interview, it is good for them to enter feedback about the candidate before talking to other interviewers. This avoids people biasing each other and forces each interviewer to take a written stance on a candidate. You can also adopt a numeric ranking system (e.g., 1-5 points) or a simple ""hire, no hire"" scale. The key is consistency, as well as providing interviewers with a clear definition of what these outputs should mean. Consistent scoring can allow you to quickly reject or pursue candidates. In general, your scoring system prevents interviewers from having the easy out of a ""neutral"" option. Hence the ""hire/no hire"" framework would lack a ""no opinion"" option.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Recruiting, hiring and managing talent|Move fast|Every company I have ever worked for, or with, has realized that one of the biggest determinants of candidate conversion is how quickly you interview them and how quickly you can make an offer. Beyond conversion, a key metric to track is how long candidates spend in each step of the interview process. You should optimize for shorter times between each step and for rapidly getting offers out.

- Elad Gil",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Recruiting, hiring and managing talent|Check candidates' references|Reference checks are often the clearest signal on a candidate. You should reference-check everyone. Be careful with businesspeople--they tend to provide friends in their organization as references, and in general will get glowing recommendations from their friends. I have found engineering and other functions to be more direct/honest when providing references for their friends. To compensate for this, try to broaden the scope of references you check for businesspeople to other functions to ensure clarity of their skills and areas for improvement.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Scaling a recruiting organization|Check candidates' references|The use of recruiters by a startup will shift dramatically over the lifetime of the company.
As a small startup (e.g., 3-10 people), using a recruiter is usually not as useful as direct founder or employee networking, using LinkedIn and other tools. In contrast, when I was at Twitter, the company grew from ~90 to ~1,500 people over a 2.5 year period. As your company scales into the hundreds and thousands of people, you will want to bring specialized recruiters, sourcers, university programs managers, etc. in-house and potentially use retained external recruiters for executive hires.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Scaling a recruiting organization|Early days: Your team as recruiters|Early on, the best approach to recruiting is to have people on your team actively refer in people from their network. Similarly, many founders & early employees spend as much as 30-50% of their time early on (e.g., when scaling from 3 to 15 people) on recruiting. There is no easy fix around it. You need to just grind through large numbers of people (via networking, LinkedIn, friends, etc.) to find the handful of people to join your team.
Some startups I know successfully hire someone who is a mix of office manager/social media manager/recruiting coordinator. This person will often spend a lot of time scheduling referred candidates and reaching out to passive candidates via email and LinkedIn. Once the candidate expresses interest they pass them off to a founder or hiring manager.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Scaling a recruiting organization|Initial scaling: The in-house recruiter|Once a company hits a certain scale and is growing fast enough (adding 15-20 people per year or more), hiring in-house recruiters makes a lot of sense. The recruiter initially plays a few different roles that in larger stage companies will get split up including
Depending on the strength of the recruiter (and, importantly, the company branding with your candidates), the recruiter will be able to hire 1-4 engineers per month. This shifts as the company scales and adds more differentiated roles (see below).
This means that if you are hiring fewer then 15 engineers a year, you may want to have a part-time or split-role recruiter, grow organically via company referrals, or find an alternative structure with external recruiters.
For non-engineering roles (e.g., sales) a single recruiter may be able to hire a larger number of people per month. This is driven in part by the referral-heavy nature of sales hiring as well as the fact that there are fewer high-growth companies for sales, marketing, and business development people to go to. In contrast, every startup is trying to hire engineers and designers.
Things that impact the ability of the recruiter to be effective include:
The importance of the hiring manager and other executives being involved in the recruiting process (through informal conversations, extending offers, meeting for lunch, etc.) cannot be over-emphasized, no matter how strong a recruiting org you have. The candidates will always want exposure to people in key roles in the company (Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook is famous for his ""closing walks"" with mid-level candidates).
""The importance of the hiring manager and other executives being involved in the recruiting process cannot be over-emphasized.""
- Elad Gil",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Scaling a recruiting organization|High-growth: Multiple recruiting org roles|When a company is growing really fast, the set of roles on the recruiting team tends to fragment and you need to start to specialize the types of people on your recruiting team.
1. Sourcers. Sourcers research, cold call, email, and otherwise create a path to passive candidates. In some cases they then transfer the candidates over to recruiters who will feed the candidate into a coordinated interview process. Some sourcers manage candidates up through an onsite interview, but seldom beyond.
2. Recruiters. Recruiters manage the process of coordination of the candidate through scheduling various interviews (phone screens, onsite, executive, etc.) and then circling with the team or hiring manager to determine whether an offer will be extended. At some companies the recruiter may extend the offer, in others the hiring manager does so.
Your first few in-house recruiters should have experience sourcing as well. This helps in a number of ways:
Splitting the recruiter and sourcer roles tends to work best when you are hiring large number of people of a specific type. For example, if you need to hire 50 back-end engineers, 30 front-end engineers, and 20 PMs, starting to segment recruiting roles makes a big difference.
3. Candidate researchers. These people may scrub LinkedIn for all the engineers at Google, prioritize them, put them into a spreadsheet, and then hand off the spreadsheet to the sourcers to actually do the outreach/pitch the candidates to interview.
These people usually only really get added to the team as it scales from 100+ to 1,000+ people, and you are hiring large numbers of people in the same role.
4. Recruiting marketing. These are the folks who develop marketing materials, run ads, organize recruiting events, hackathons, website content, etc. to create an inbound pipeline of candidates. At a startup, this is usually driven by someone on the team you are recruiting for (e.g., an engineering manager for engineering candidates). Alternatively, the marketing team at the startup may be responsible for this as part of their overall marketing efforts. Only as a company scales to a few hundred people or more does the possibility of a standalone coordinating recruiting marketing role emerge.
5. University programs. Given the specific timing and cadence of new graduate and intern hiring, some companies will specialize sourcers and recruiters specifically for coordination and hiring of new grads. When your startup is still small, instead of hiring dedicated university programs people, you can have your existing recruiting staff pivot to cover this area for the few months when it is most relevant.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil

Acknowledge their work but ramp them down as quickly as is reasonable so the new employee can find their legs.

"Old-timer syndrome & early employees|Early employees that scale|Some of the most valuable long-term employees of a high-growth company join early on. These employees often have earned the trust and admiration of the founders and CEO, and they have the cultural context and long-term mission of the company in mind, which enables them to achieve outsized things in a high-growth startup. Examples like Susan Wojciki (Google employee #16 and eventual CEO of YouTube) and Google and Chris Cox at Facebook (who joined as an engineer in 2005 and is now chief product officer) come to mind.
Unfortunately, some early employees also dramatically overstay their optimal tenure at a company as it scales. They may have gotten too rich and lost their hunger, or simply not scaled their skill set and mindset along with the company. Some cling to the past when they had lunch every day with the CEO and had input into every company decision.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Old-timer syndrome & early employees|Early employees that scale|Early employees that can grow and scale responsibilities within a company are invaluable. They can channel the mindset of founders/CEO (and therefore get quick buy-in for their teams), have the trust of the executive team and their peers, understand internal processes and jargon, and have a deep understanding of the company operating procedures and culture. Their ""old timer"" status allows them to challenge convention (or provide context on it) in ways that enable them to reshape or remove rules or old processes.
While many early employees may lack deep functional or industry expertise, the trust of the CEO allows them to hire, manage, and learn from more experienced industry executives. Early employees who are humble enough to realize they can learn from fresh blood can grow with the company and use it as a personal platform for their own learning and impact. Some early employees will stick with a breakout company for decades and their personal story arc mirrors that of the company. These employees tend to be hungry to learn from others, understand that the company, their role, and its culture will inevitably evolve, and are open to change.
""Early employees who are humble enough to realize they can learn from fresh blood can grow with the company and use it as a personal platform for their own learning and impact.""

"Hiring executives|Traits to look for in executives|First-time founders or CEOs typically find it hard to hire the first executives to join the team. As a founder, often without deep work experience, you have pulled off the impossible and created a product or service lots of people want to use or pay for. And you did so without any fancy executive-type people from Google or Facebook, with their expensive paychecks and reliance on process.
At some point, however, you will notice that lots of things start to break down. Communication within the company gets gummed up. Various product teams start to lose coordination. You don't have time to get every important thing done in the day, and indeed you start to run out of time to think. Your hiring process falls apart, and it takes weeks for you to follow up with candidates. Your sales pipeline is largely dependent on you and a handful of inexperienced individual contributors--and suddenly follow-through crashes to a halt. You may try to promote existing employees (who also have no prior experience) to run various areas, and in most cases this fails or does not really help anything.
Suddenly you realize that you really need someone with more experience on your team.
Hiring executives for the first time can be quite tricky for a founder. However, once you hire your first seasoned exec who works out, you will be grateful for her presence. All sorts of things will magically just get done. People will get hired, deals will get closed, process will tighten up. It can be a wondrous experience. You will kick yourself for not hiring an experienced, high-capacity executive sooner.
""Once you hire your first seasoned exec who works out, you will be grateful for her presence. All sorts of things will magically get done. People will get hired, deals will get closed, process will tighten up. It can be a wondrous experience.""
- Elad Gil
Unfortunately, things could also go badly. The executive is a bad culture fit, or is too senior for the role and spins his wheels. Time is wasted and progress lost on a poor fit--or even worse, some of the best people on your team quit when managed by someone who's not working out.
Finding a great executive for your company can be challenging, but it's well worth the effort. And there are some steps you can take to maximize your chances of success:",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Hiring executives|Traits to look for in executives|If you have a 10-person engineering team, and in 12 months it will grow to 30 people, you do not need to hire an SVP from Salesforce whose job is to manage a 1,500-person team. This person will get bored with the small job offered to her and may simply spin her wheels. She is too senior for the role.
When hiring executives, look for people who have the experience and background that would make them a good fit or hire for the next 12-18 months. Anything shorter than that and they will not be able to scale sufficiently far relative to the time it takes to hire them. Anything longer and you will over-hire and end up with someone who is a bad fit for the job. Whatever the role, there are a few key skills and traits that you want your executives to bring to the table:
1. Functional area expertise.
2. Ability to build and manage a team in those functional areas.
3. Collegiality.
4. Strong communication skills.
5. Owner mentality.
6. Smarts and strategic thinking skills.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Hiring executives|Define the role & meet with people who do it well|Most of the time, a founder will have no idea what to look for when hiring someone to run a particular company function. What does a CFO, general counsel, or even VP of sales really do day-to-day? How can you spot someone who is exceptional at each role? What characteristics should one type of VP have versus another? For example, how does a VP of engineering differ from a VP of sales, or even a CFO?
If you want to learn more about what a great CFO or VP of engineering does, your best bet is to reach out to people who are great at these roles and ask them for advice. Your investors or mentors may be able to suggest which companies have the best people for each function. For example, if you are hiring a CFO, go and meet three or four great CFOs at companies a few years ahead of yours or larger public companies known for excellence like Google or Netflix. What would they hire for in a CFO? What traits would they look for? What interview questions, work projects, tests, reference-checking questions, or other approaches would they take to vet a candidate in this area? For your company size and 18-month growth road map, what should you look for?
In order to get in touch with great leaders in finance, sales, engineering, and more, ask your investors or advisors for introductions. Or, you can ask the founders of other companies that are a few years ahead of you to introduce you to their CFOs or VPs of product for advice and perhaps candidate suggestions.
Once you have figured out what you want in the role, write it down and share it with the team that will be interviewing candidates for that executive hire. You want everyone to have a common view of what to look for, as well as what to select against. You can also use this as an opportunity to reemphasize the cultural characteristics the candidate must embody. Clearly establishing what you are hiring for will make a huge difference as you collect your team's feedback and discuss candidates. It will also prevent poor hiring (or, alternatively, rejection of a great candidate) due to a lack of common understanding of what you are looking for.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Do you need a COO?|Why a COO?|Ten years ago, if you were the founder of a high-growth company it was reasonably likely that your investors would want to bring in ""adult supervision"" as CEO to run your company. This has shifted, in recent years, to a slate of COO hires, following the example set by Facebook with the successful run of Sheryl Sandberg. It is now much more likely for a breakout high-growth company to hire a COO to support the company founders, rather than a CEO to replace them. 1
Box, Facebook, Stripe, Square, Twitter, and Yelp are all companies that chose at one time or another to hire a COO as a complement to the founders, rather than replace the CEO with a ""gray-haired professional operator."" 2",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Do you need a COO?|Why a COO?|Hiring a COO is not about adding a title to your org chart, but rather finding the background and experience you are looking for. Optimally, you want someone who will come in to complement, operationalize, and execute your vision as a founder. Many technical or product-focused founders want to (and should) remain focused on the product and overall market strategy. In parallel, the COO would build out and manage areas that the founders lack interest or experience in, or simply don't have the bandwidth to oversee.
""You want someone who will come in to complement, operationalize, and execute your vision as a founder.""
- Elad Gil
The responsibilities of a COO, for example, might include:
1. Adding executive bandwidth. The COO can serve as a business partner for technical or product-focused founders.
2. Scaling the company. High-growth companies have special needs around scaling and implementing simple processes (e.g., recruiting infrastructure, corporate governance, etc.).
3. Building out the executive team and organizational scaffold. COOs are often responsible for executives and teams in areas founders don't understand well (e.g., finance, accounting, and sales). They can help in screening and hiring executives for product, engineering, and marketing as well.
4. Taking on the areas founders don't have time for, are poorly suited for, or don't want to focus on. Typically, a COO takes on responsibility for ongoing management of the ""business side"" (corporate development/M&A, business development, sales, HR, recruiting, etc.), while the founders continue to focus on product, design, and engineering (e.g., Mark Zuckerberg's focus on product at Facebook). There are some counterexamples of this too where the CEO wants to be sales focused and hires in a product-centric COO.
5. Shaping the culture for the next phase of the company's life. Sheryl Sandberg has impacted how Facebook is run across the entire organization by, for example, bringing a culture of people development and managerial excellence.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"How to hire great business development people|Great business development people|Great business development (BD) people are hard to find. You may meet a smart, charismatic, articulate BD person who can't get anything done. Or a highly networked deal person who leaks value when he misses all the details of a deal and structures terrible terms. It can be hard to differentiate between what deals people actually accomplish versus what they take credit for in terms of a product's success.
So what should you look for in a BD person?",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"How to hire great business development people|Great business development people|Smart people with lots of raw horsepower. Smart, creative, and think well on their feet.
Articulate/good communicators. Need to communicate well with both internal teams (engineers, PMs, lawyers, execs) as well as the customer or partner (which may include their legal, engineering, and deal people).
Creative/fearless in deal terms. Push the envelope on what is possible and are willing to make a crazy ask of the partner or client. You never know what someone will give away until you ask.
Able to get shit done. Have a history of closing multiple complex deals with creative or aggressive terms. One person who worked for me at Twitter closed three or four partnerships while he was a part-time intern working remotely during his school year.
Structured/can run a deal process. Structure is underrated in deal people. You want someone great at shepherding all internal and external stakeholders through the various phases of a deal (ideation, pitching, negotiating, structuring, closing, implementing).1You want these people mining a list of prospects, aggressively framing a negotiation, and setting up internal prep meetings before calling external parties. Unstructured deal people create churn internally due to a lack of consensus on external gives or lack of planning for a negotiation.
Detail-oriented. Reid Hoffman once told me he expected his deal people to read every word of every contract, including all the legal language. This allows them to catch all sorts of gotchas that are otherwise buried in unexpected ways and to think through the implications of what the contract says.
Part lawyer. Able to pick up and grok key legal nuances, even without an overt legal background.
Good culture fit/put the company first. You want your businesspeople, like all your employees, to put the company first. There are all sorts of ways businesspeople may benefit themselves rather than the company (more on this below).
Able to work well with others across the organization.
Pragmatic and keep big picture in mind. Figure out what is important, optimize for it (80:20 rule), and get the deal done. Don't optimize for little things that don't matter, except as a negotiation tactic. Similarly, some deals should not get done. Great deal people will take a step back and decide whether to walk away, and they won't try to force a deal to happen if it shouldn't. Some of the best ""deals"" are the ones that don't happen.
Able to understand partner and market needs. Understand what partners really want (versus what they claim they want), as well as trends in the marketplace that may impact both their company's and as well as the partner's leverage and needs.
Tenacious. Deals can take a long time and a lot of back and forth. Bad deal people give up toward the very end to ""just close the deal"" and may leak enormous amounts of value that they didn't need to give up.
Relentless. Sometimes you need to keep knocking at a door over and over until someone finally answers.
Moral compass. Like all employees, you want people who will do the right thing even if it uncomfortable or against their self-interest to do so.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"How to hire great business development people|Bad business development people|Bad business development people may exhibit the following:
Great at selling, bad on follow-through. Some BD people are charming, fun to talk to, and really smart. Unfortunately, they have terrible follow-through and can't seem to get anything closed. They may be full of empty excuses for why they had to give on a major term that is important to your company. The only way to screen these people out is reference checks, as they are great at selling, poor on substance. Raw charisma is drastically overrated by technical founders. Don't be fooled just because someone is friendly and charming.
Disorganized/unstructured. Fly by the seat of their pants, don't send follow-ups, or communicate poorly internally. Needless meetings or internal churn often result.
Leak value. Often overthink what is ""fair"" for the other side. Make too many assumptions about what is important to the other side and just give a lot of terms away. Or, they just want to close the deal at all costs versus thinking through what is actually good for the company they work for.
Don't think like an owner. Bad deal people don't think like business owners. They treat the company's money or resources as not a big deal to use and will give away extra value in a negotiation because ""it doesn't matter,"" ""it's within 20%,"" or the like.
Don't think the details matter. See above.
Outsource too much. Bad deal people become too dependent on other company functions--for example, not understanding a legal term that comes up over and over because ""that's Legal's problem."" Sometimes terms important to the business are buried or hidden as legalese or ""technical specs."" A great deal person will ferret these out.
Optimize for themselves and their network versus the company. As gatekeepers to external parties, some business development people may use this point of leverage to benefit themselves. They may build relationships at the expense of the company by being too easy on a deal so that the partner likes them. Or they may constantly network at external boondoggles and on panels to build their own reputations, rather than working. 2
Display a cowboy mentality. Some deal people go off and strike a deal, or mention terms to an external party that you can't back away from, without any internal discussion or approval. They may act defensive when questioned about this and feel they are ""getting it done.""
Are emotional. Deals have a lot of ups and downs--you need an even keel.
Spin things internally. Deal people need to be able to ""turn it off"" when it comes to selling something internally to their boss, peers, or executive team. You need to hire people who won't BS or spin internally, even if it is sometimes their job to do it externally.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"How to hire great business development people|How to screen for a great business development person|History of deals. What deals have they themselves negotiated? How complex were the terms? What is an ask they received that no one else at the company believed they would get? What is a clever deal hack they pulled off? What impact did the deal actually have on the company?
References. Deal people often have lots of friends, as their job is outwardly focused and they can be charismatic. They may give you a long list of meaningless references (e.g., friends at their current company, who actually don't know much about their work but think they are a ""great person""). Get references from people who worked with them directly on deals. Back channel more information on them. Ask about the specific deals they worked on, how relentless and creative they were, and the tangible impact their deals had on the company. Did the terms end up working out or backfiring? Were there edge cases they did not think about that came back to bite? Did they champion a radical position that paid off big?
Follow-through. How is their follow-through during the interview process? How structured are they? What approach do they take in negotiating compensation?
Culture. What are they optimizing for? Title? Equity? Future growth? Something else? How do they fit in your culture? Businesspeople will be different from technical or product people in a number of ways, but they should still hold to your core cultural values.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Organizational growth is all about pragmatism|If you are growing fast, you have a different company every 6-12 months|First-time CEOs and entrepreneurs often call me to discuss how to structure their organizations. Common questions include: Should I hire a COO or not? Who should the VP marketing report to? How should I split up product and engineering? Should our international arm build out its own functions or be matrixed with U.S. headquarters?
There is often fear in the mind of the entrepreneur that there is a ""right"" answer to how to structure an organization--and that if she screws it up by doing the ""wrong"" thing, the implications could be disastrous. This is an incorrect perspective. Most of the time there is no ""right"" answer and org structure is really an exercise in pragmatism. That is, what is the right structure given the talent available to your company, the set of initiatives you need to pursue, and your company's 12- to 18-month time horizon?
Here are a few key takeaways and things to keep in mind about org structure:",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Organizational growth is all about pragmatism|If you are growing fast, you have a different company every 6-12 months|When I joined Google, it grew from around 1,500 to 15,000 people in three-and-a-half years. After my startup was acquired by Twitter, Twitter grew from about 90 to 1,500 people in less than three years. A company that grows that rapidly is literally a different company every six months. This means that every 6-12 months the company's org structure may change.
When choosing an organizational structure for your high-growth startup, focus on the next 6-12 months. Don't try to find the ""long-term"" solution, as in the long term your company will be completely different and have radically different needs. Eventually, your executive team will start to stabilize but the teams under them will have more frequent re-orgs as each organization ramps in size.
""Eventually, your executive team will start to stabilize but the teams under them will have more frequent re-orgs as each organization ramps in size.""
- Elad Gil",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Organizational growth is all about pragmatism|There is no right answer|Often there is no one answer to how to structure your organization. Rather, it is a series of trade-offs. Two different structures may be equally ""good"" and ""bad."" Don't sweat it too much--ultimately if you make a mistake, it will be painful but you can undo it.
Communicate to the team that as your company grows quickly, things will shift around. Make it clear that it is normal for that to happen--it's a sign of your success-- and that other companies that grow fast do the same thing.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Organizational growth is all about pragmatism|Sometimes bandwidth matters more than perfect fit|Executive bandwidth may be more important than a traditional reporting chain. For example, Alex Macgillivray, the talented former general counsel at Twitter, had user support, trust and safety, corporate development/M&A, and other areas reporting to him at various times, in addition to legal. Many of these departments normally would not report to a GC, but Alex was talented enough to take on more in the absence of other executives with bandwidth to own these areas. As new executives were hired or promoted, things then transferred over to them from Alex.
As CEO, you should look at your team and allocate functional areas based in part on who has the time and skill set to focus on and make that area succeed. This does not mean the chosen executive needs to manage that area forever. Remember, nothing needs to be permanent. There are also some cases that don't make sense from a tie-breaking or skill set perspective--e.g., your VP engineering should probably not run sales in addition to engineering. However, if needed, your VP engineering could potentially manage the design or product teams in the short term or, if it makes sense to do so, even longer term.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Organizational growth is all about pragmatism|Org structure is often about tie-breaking|Reporting chains are ultimately about decision-making. For example, there is a natural tension between engineering and product management, so where do you want most decisions to be taken if the two groups disagree? The person who both functions report to ultimately functions as the tie-breaker between the orgs. This is a good heuristic to keep in mind when thinking about org structure.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Doing a re-organization|Re-orgs at the company level and the functional level|When your company is in hypergrowth, you will be doubling the team every 6-12 months on average. At that pace you could go from 20 to ~300 people in two years and to 500 or 1,000 people in four years. You will be adding new functions rapidly (finance, HR, legal), potentially expanding internationally, while product road maps will expand and new areas will be launched or acquired into the company.
You will effectively be working at or running a different company every 6-12 months, with most of the people at the company having joined in the last 12 months. When I was at Google, it more or less 10X-ed from 1,500 or 2,000 people when I joined to >15,000 people when I left 3.5 years later. My startup was acquired when Twitter was ~90 people, and I left a full-time role with Twitter at over 1,000 employees. 90% of the people at Twitter had not been with the company just 2.5 years earlier.
As the company scales and increases in complexity you will also need to change the organizational structure of the company to reflect new executives, new functions, more employees, and changing alignment against your market and product. In other words, re-orgs will occur at the company frequently.
Early on many of the re-orgs will be at the executive level and then cascade down. As you add more functional areas, there will be finer division of executive roles. If you add a CMO or other CX-level person then some of the executive roles may consolidate under that individual.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Doing a re-organization|Re-orgs at the company level and the functional level|Early on, you may re-org the entire company frequently. But once you hit 500 to 1,000 people, you should expect fewer company-level re-orgs and many more interfunctional re-orgs. For example, a change within the structure of the sales team, versus changes across all teams simultaneously. Some teams such as sales are more likely to re-org frequently at that point as they scale, while others like product and engineering tend to be more stable. Part of this has to do with where head count grows and needs change most rapidly in a company as it switches from being solely product-centric, to focusing more on go-to-market. The biggest cross-company re-orgs later as the company scales will occur when changing product/engineering/go-to-market simultaneously, adding new product areas or acquisitions, if a company flips from a matrix to business unit-like organization, or flips between centralized and decentralized internationalization.
Early on, you as CEO will need to be adept at re-orgs. Later, as re-orgs shift more frequently to functional organization, you will need to make sure your leadership team knows how to approach them. Most companies and new managers screw up their first re-org or two, causing unnecessary pain in the organization. Below is a simple guide to re-orgs.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Company culture and its evolution|Never, ever compromise: Hiring for culture|As your company scales, your culture will change with it. You will be hiring a broader set of functions, bona fide executives who can function at scale, and probably people with less risk tolerance and more process tolerance. At the same time your company will grow ten- to a hundred-fold in size which means communications, processes, and adherence to various internal controls for an IPO or other reasons will need to increase. It is inevitable your culture will change alongside everything else.
As the founder or CEO you will be responsible for determining which parts of the culture you need to keep, what to morph, and what to drop altogether. You will need to communicate to veteran employees that these cultural changes are needed just as you need to keep iterating on your products and team. Your biggest levers for shaping culture have to do with who you hire, the behaviors you emphasize and reward, and the people you let go.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Company culture and its evolution|Never, ever compromise: Hiring for culture|While your company should be focused on diversity of background, ethnicity, gender, class, and other attributes in employees, it should also look for cohesion in purpose, intent, and baseline culture. Your culture acts as an unwritten set of rules and values that drive behavior and cohesion across the company. Your company culture is the foundation on which everything you do rests.
Cohesive cultures are more resilient and can withstand shocks (fierce competition in the market, bad press cycles, a product failure, or other issues). They can also be extremely motivational and draw out the best in people (e.g., engineers at Palantir who used to sleep under their desks in the belief that they were helping national security, or the emergence of Google's ""don't be evil"" doctrine).",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Company culture and its evolution|Bad culture leads to pain|Most companies do a poor job of pursuing a common culture or are willing to sacrifice it when they hire in order to ""get someone effective"" or ""fill a need."" This typically backfires in a big way over the short- to medium term. Every single founder I know who has compromised on culture when hiring has regretted it due to the disruptions it has caused their company: having to fire bad actors, creating a crappy work environment, good people quitting, trust eroding between coworkers, product moving in the wrong direction, misaligned incentives emerging in the organization, etc.

Growth marketing focuses on moving a handful of key metrics (e.g., signups, logins, conversions) in an ROI-focused manner.

"Hiring marketing and PR teams|Marketing organization structure|As you can imagine, there are large differences between most hires for a growth marketing role (quantitative, numbers driven) and PR (media relations, focus on the pitch, relationship building, telling a story).

In contrast, a communications hire will focus on storytelling, positioning, and process management.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Hiring marketing and PR teams|Marketing organization structure|Like all organization decisions, there's no right answer about which executive the marketing team should report into. Making the decision is an exercise in pragmatism. In enterprise or sales-heavy companies, marketing may report into sales, product, the COO, or directly to the CEO. Marketing may be matrixed across different lines of business, or directly into each business unit. Sometimes product marketing will report into product management while PR and branding will report into another organization.
A recent trend has been to combine regulatory affairs or lobbying with PR and communications. regulatory affairs is also often found under your legal team, proving again that organizational structure is an exercise in pragmatism.
Given the code driven aspects of growth marketing, some parts of the growth marketing team may consist of engineers reporting into an engineering group versus a marketing org.

"PR Basics|Get media trained|In the early days your company will be too small and have too little timely news to merit a full-time PR person. As the company grows, you will hire one or more PR people in house, and will often augment the in-house work with an agency.
Here are some simple basics to get you started on PR. Your internal PR team or your agency should start things off by media training you and any other members of your team who will be officially representing the company and/ or speaking to press. Media training will include definition of key terms (What does ""off the record"" mean versus ""on background?""), what you can expect during different types of interviews (broadcast, in-person, phone, video, etc.), as well as practice sessions primarily focused on answering tough questions. You should practice the storyline for your company and be able to answer questions about your products, your competitors, and yourself concisely. In general, you and your cofounders will be encouraged to have a founding narrative about the company and a personal explanation for why you are working on your company. Media training will also focus on things like how to answer a question other than the one you were asked (if needed).",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"PR Basics|On background versus off the record versus on the record|Practice, practice, practice. Imagine that you are an actor in a play. Read through your narrative and practice your storyline. Your PR team or executive team can help you practice objection handling, fielding tough questions, and delivering the core company story. Repeat it until you have a crisp story memorized. At the same time, remember that authenticity is key. Reporters will know if you're reading from a script and it'll come across as less genuine, which can sometimes be a credibility killer. If you are on the phone with press, it is okay to have a written document in front of you to remind you of key talking points. When talking to press, you should specify the nature of the conversation and get agreement from the reporter on the terms. This is typically something your PR person will work out in advance with the reporter, and also reconfirm at the start of the call. If there is not agreement, you should assume everything you say is on the record. The general breakouts are:",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"PR Basics|Correcting factual errors|In order to maintain independence and journalistic integrity, reporters are not always willing to run a story by you before it's published. If the press has made an error in fact (versus opinion) it is okay to reach out to the journalist when the story runs to correct the factual error. Factual error means things like ""they misunderstood a scientific fact"" or ""they got the name of the product wrong."" Factual error does not mean ""they hate my product"" or ""they didn't understand its value.""
Given how hard people work on their companies, CEOs may get emotional or upset about press coverage. Realize that most of the press coverage will be forgotten in the future, and most companies have had a bad story or two (or ten) at some point or another.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"PR Basics|Press agendas|Most people in the press are hard-working, ethical people trying to do the right thing. Occasionally you will also run across someone who has an agenda. No matter what you tell them, they will write the story the way they want it to fit a predefined narrative and they will massage facts.
It is a good idea to read a journalist's previous stories before speaking with them. If they have a long history of writing thoughtless attack pieces, you should decide how much you want to engage or talk with them.

"PR Basics|Press relationship building|The PR community is a small one. There are only a few dozen truly great PR people in technology at any given time. They all tend to cluster at a handful of companies and all know each other. The best way to find a great PR person is to ask other PR people, agencies, and journalists who they respect the most and who does the best work, and then go after those people. Sometimes, you can also hire a great partner-level person out of a PR agency. In the early days, it will take an investment of time to build relationships with key members of the press. This may include reaching out with articles unrelated to your company that may interest the journalist, or meeting for coffee to discuss the industry without other agendas. It is important to invest in these relationships and avoid transactional behavior. This will increase the likelihood your company will get covered.
As your company scales, building these relationships will continue to be important. However, as CEO you should be judicious with your time. Figure out what other members of your executive team you want to be spokespersons, and start to have them take the lead on some of the press relationships.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"PR Basics|Engage PR early|It often takes 4-10 weeks for a company to coordinate a big PR launch--more if you are just onboarding a new PR agency or your existing agency isn't up to speed on the new product yet. Don't wait for the week before the launch to let your PR team or agency know what is coming. Just like design, product communications should be part of the product launch timing from early in the process rather than being an afterthought. Some companies like Amazon go through the exercise of writing the product ""headline"" at the stage of product conception. For example, when writing a design document, you might think through what the press story on the product will be when it launches. This helps to shape crisp thinking about what you are building and why.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil

Bad product management organizations, in contrast, largely function as project management groups, running schedules and tidying up documents for engineers.
To build a great product organization you need to first understand the role of the product manager. Secondly, you need to hire individuals with the right skill sets, including a strong VP of product. Finally, establish a simple set of processes to enable the product organization and help the company scale its product development.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Product management overview|What do product managers do?|At a high level, a product manager (PM) is the single cross-functional owner directly responsible for the success of a product. Some pundits call PMs the ""general manager of the product"" or ""CEO of the product."" In reality, a product manager is the directly responsible individual for a product--they have all the responsibility for the product's success but often lack the direct line reporting of the other functions.
Product managers are responsible for:
1. Product strategy and vision. What is the goal of the product? Who is the customer? What are the primary features and use cases? How do we define success and what metrics can we use to track the product? What are the competitive dynamics and how should we position the product against competitors? How will the product differentiate? What are some key distribution channels? What is the business model for the product? How should we price the product? The product manager will work with many other functions (design, marketing, sales, engineering, data science, etc.) to answer the questions above, but should ultimately be in charge of asking and answering these questions.
The product strategy and vision should also reflect the voice of the customer. The product manager should be on top of incorporating user input and feedback into the product lifecycle.
2. Product prioritization & problem solving. Product managers ""own"" the product road map and are responsible for ensuring it has the right set of trade-offs. Tactical aspects of this include: writing and receiving feedback on PRDs (product requirement documents), organizing/directing product road mapping sessions, working with all the functions mentioned above, and making trade-offs on features versus impact and work needed. Crisp product requirement documents can make a world of difference in driving concise agreement on, and execution of, the product. PRDs should clearly articulate primary features and product needs.
""Crisp product requirement documents can make a world of difference in driving concise agreement on, and execution of, the product. PRDs should clearly articulate primary features and product needs.""
- Elad Gil
These responsibilities require a PM to be data- and customer-driven. Defining the right metrics, getting agreement on them, and then tracking them enables more alignment on product priorities. The more technical the product manager, the more likely they are able to analyze the data needed to make crucial trade-offs. In parallel, the product manager should strive to understand customer needs and then make trade-offs versus relative to engineering cost or business impact.
Product managers will also spend time problem-solving aspects of the product or its development. For example, how could the product be tweaked or changed to avoid a legal or regulatory issue? How could features be modified to address a competitive or pricing concern from sales?
Note: product managers will not work on this alone. Building a product, and solving related problems is a team effort. PMs will coordinate with engineering (technical constraints and feature ideas), design, data science, marketing, sales, support, legal (regulatory issues), and other functions. However, the ultimate role of product management is making or suggesting trade-offs between the pristine, platonic ideal of beauty that the design team wants, the technical pizzazz engineering desires, the ""just give me some shit I can sell"" of sales, and the ""this may be risky"" of legal (these examples are all purposefully exaggerated).
3. Execution: timelines, resources, and removal of obstacles.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Product management overview|What do product managers do?|As part of driving the success of a product, product managers should work closely with engineering to set and hit goals on time. Often the biggest ways a product manager can help the team hit goals includes (a) lobbying for resources or attention from engineering, design, and other functions, (b) removing or prioritizing features and providing a clear road map for execution, (c) asking ""stupid"" questions to see if it is possible for each function to reduce timelines or remove unneeded features or work, and (d) pushing back on extraneous requests, whether those are internal (design, sales, etc.) or external (customers, partners).
Many people associate product execution as something that ends when you launch a product. In reality there is ongoing product maintenance, feature iteration, and eventually the sunsetting or killing of a product. Deprecating a product can be an art in its own right as you transition customers off, deal with pricing changes, or other issues that may cause customer backlash.
It is important to note that product managers are not project managers--i.e. a PM's primary job is not just running a schedule.
4. Communication and coordination (overlays all of the above). Product managers should organize and communicate team status, progress, obstacles, and functional sequencing to the rest of the organization. This may include driving (or co-driving with engineering) weekly team status meetings, product reviews with the leadership team, and communicating launch or other timelines across the organization.
Often the hardest part of the communication is communicating the ""why"" behind the product road map, prioritization, and sequencing. Part of this will be creating a framework that establishes why some things are prioritized higher than others--and it's important that all other functions buy into this framework.
Ultimately, product management will collaborate closely with, and at times have a natural (collaborative) tension with, engineering, design, and sales. Engineering will feel that since they are building everything, they should have the power to make product decisions. Design will think product management is redundant with design (these are very different functions,) and sales will wonder why product can't ship faster and why the PM is always trying to keep sales people away from engineers (it is so engineers can focus on building the product without spending all their time on one-off sales requests).
Product managers should also function as the ""buffer"" or shield that protects engineers and designers from other internal and external parties. Sales and marketing people will always want to meet engineers directly to lobby for their favorite features, while customers will want to have a conversation directly with engineering. Product management should be a smart buffer for these interactions and consolidate all input and questions into a weekly internal team meeting, or the PM can act as the primary point of contact for sales. This will prevent sales, marketing, and other organizations from draining too much engineering and design time. That said, sometimes the best way to convince an engineer of a customer need is to put her in front of a customer. Hearing customer feedback first-hand can often change minds or shape a great brainstorm or problem-solving session.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Characteristics of great product managers|Hiring product managers|When hiring product managers, you should select for the following skills:
1. Product taste. Product taste means having the insights and intuition to understand customer needs for a product in a given area. What product features will wow a customer or meet their core needs? If the PM is joining you from another industry they may not know the specific needs of your customers. However, they should have the skill set and tool kit to quickly learn about your customers and their needs.
2. Ability to prioritize. What is the value of a proposed product feature versus the engineering work needed to accomplish it? What is more important--a new product for the sales team or a feature for customers? Should pricing be optimized for consumers or small business owners? What is the 80% product that should be launched immediately and what singular customer problem does it solve?
3. Ability to execute. A big part of product management is convincing and cajoling teams and different resources to get the product to launch, and then to maintain the product and support the customer base. Product managers will partner with engineering, design, legal, customer support, and other functions to execute on the product road map.
4. Strategic sensibilities. How is the industry landscape evolving? How can the product be positioned to make an end run around the competition? Intel's famous pricing strategy in the 1970s is a good example of a bold strategic move. At the time Intel understood there was a strong reduction in their own costs as they scaled unit sales. Dropping unit sales would lead to increased demand and volume, causing a virtuous cycle. Intel smartly decided to launch a new silicon product at cost below their COGs in order to scale market share faster. In response, their customers bought in volumes they had not projected until two years out, causing a massively lower cost structure for them and therefore profitability. In other words, their low pricing became self-fulfilling and sustainable through massive volumes years ahead of projections.
5. Top 10% communication skills. Much of the job of a product manager boils down to understanding and then communicating trade-offs to a diverse group of coworkers and external parties.
6. Metrics and data-driven approach. You build what you measure. Part of the role of a product manager is to work with engineering and the data science team to define the set of metrics the product team should track. Setting the right metrics can be hard, and even the right metrics can sometimes drive the wrong behavior.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Characteristics of great product managers|The four types of product managers|The product manager you hire depends on the type of product your company is working on. Often companies need a mix of the below. Some people can function as more than one type of PM, while other individuals are hard wired to only do one of the below well.
1. Business product manager
These product managers are strongest at synthesizing external customer requests into an internal product road map. Business PMs tend to thrive at enterprise software companies, or working on the partner-facing portions of consumer applications. They can work well with sales and present well to customers, yet are still technical enough to work with engineering and design to trade off road map versus engineering effort needed. They will have keener insights into product pricing, customer segmentation, and customer needs.
2. Technical product manager
Technical PMs are often (but not always) deeply technical people who can work with engineering on areas like infrastructure, search quality, machine learning, or other inward-facing work. Technical PMs can often work on a wide variety of products across enterprise and consumer as long as they can pick up the necessary business skills and have good user intuition to make the right trade-offs in the product.
3. Design product manager
Most commonly found working on consumer applications, design-centric product managers are more user experience-centric. Some companies will convert a designer to be the product manager for a consumer product. While designers are often incredibly talented at user experience and visual design, they may not be trained in making the trade-offs needed to run a business (e.g., advertising models, pricing, etc.) or may want a product to be pixel perfect (which means it will take longer to ship the product). In general, it is good to retrain design people who become product managers to focus more on pragmatic trade-offs between beauty and marketing. Design PMs spend the most time with internal engineering and design teams and tend to spend less time on outward facing or business-centric tasks.
4. Growth product manager
Growth PMs tend to be quantitative, analytical, numbers-driven, and in the best cases wildly creative and aggressive. The focus of the growth PM is to (i) determine the critical levers needed to drive product adoption and use, and then (ii) to manipulate those levers. For example, the growth team at Facebook added tens of millions of incremental users via email loops, funnel optimization, and large scale multivariate testing of sign up, conversion, and other flows. Growth PMs tend to work closely with engineering, marketing, UX, and in some cases partnership or deal teams. Sometimes growth marketing will play the role of growth product management and this role will report into marketing.
In general, the more technical and back-end heavy your product, the fewer product managers you will have. A database company is likely to have a much lower product manager to engineer ratio than a consumer internet company. When I was at Google, the search infrastructure team had a few-to-none product managers while the mobile team, which was more UI-centric and business-centric, had many (despite a much smaller engineering organization).",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Characteristics of great product managers|Not a product manager: project managers|Do not hire project managers as product managers. While project managers may be great at organizing and driving a schedule, they often lack the ability to prioritize features or ask the larger strategic questions. In general, project managers are not needed in high functioning software organizations, where a mix of the engineering manager and product manager will take on project management. Project managers may become useful for hardware products, external partner implementations, or vendor-specific hardware integrations.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Interviewing PMs|Hiring product managers|When interviewing product managers, it is important to keep in mind the role you are hiring her for (see the previous section ""The four types of product managers""), as well as the generic capabilities sought out in all product managers (see ""Characteristics of Great Product Managers"") and all hires (culture fit, etc.).
Key areas to push product managers during interviews are:
1. Product insights. What products do you use daily? How would you change X product? How would you design X product for a specific set of users? What features would you add? What would you drop/discontinue? If you were starting a company from scratch, what product would you start with, and why? For example, how would you design a mobile phone for children?
2. Contributions to past successful products. When I worked at Google, I overlapped with some of the strongest product people I ever met. I also overlapped with a number of terrible product managers who happened to be at the right place at the right time. When interviewing a product manager from a successful product, it is important to dig into their specific contributions. For example: What role did you play in the product definition and launch? Who came up with which product features? Who drove the idea to price the product X way? Etc.
3. Prioritization. Focus your questions around prioritization on the frameworks the candidate uses for making trade-offs, rather than the trade-offs themselves. You can initiate these questions by providing a scenario or case study to work from. For example: What is a real world example where your company had multiple potential product paths to invest in but could not do all of them? How would the PM approach this decision-making choice? What factors would fold into it? What data could be used? What is an example of a product feature that the executive team requested that you pushed back on or had removed?
4. Communication and team conflicts. Was the PM able to sell a vision or product to their last company's leadership team? What disagreements or conflicts did the PM have with engineering or design? How were these disagreements resolved? How does the PM actively build relationships with other parts of the organization? What communication approaches does the PM use? What is important to communicate, and when? What is an example where a miscommunication caused an issue for a product? How was this resolved and what changed from a process perspective after? In general there is a natural tension between product, design, and engineering. Conflicts may arise naturally in a fast-paced environment. The key is how to build relationships to surmount disagreements and how to resolve conflicts if they do occur.
5. Metrics and data. What metrics did the PM track for their last product? How did they choose these metrics? What bad behavior could these metrics have driven and how would you avoid this behavior? What metrics would the PM track for your company's product? Why are those the right metrics? How often and in what context should metrics be reviewed? How do you evaluate if a product launch has been successful?",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Hiring a strong VP product|Hiring product managers|In many startups the CEO may initially play the role VP product. At some point the organization and processes need to be professionalized and a VP product will need to be hired in. Many CEOs at this point are tempted to hire a ""process person"" to drive product management as the CEO feels she understands product and just needs someone to execute her vision. This is often a mistake as the company scales and more is delegated to the VP layer over time. Instead, CEOs should look for a VP product who both understands product management processes as well as has a complementary or similar vision for the product and its road map.
The role of a VP product is to:
1. Drive product strategy, road-mapping, and execution across the organization. Obviously, this is done with the guidance of the CEO who is the final authority.
2. Create and empower a professional product management discipline.
3. Set cross-company product management processes.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Money money money|Investors and returns|For the first 40 years of the technology industry, high-growth, breakout companies would go public (IPO) much earlier in their lifecycle. Intel went public two years after incorporation, Amazon when it was three years old, Apple at four, and Cisco at the ripe old age of five. Microsoft was an outlier and long in the tooth when it went public after ~10 years in 1986 (largely on the back of its 1980 deal with IBM for MS-DOS.)
In the 2000s, the timeline to IPO lengthened significantly with some companies taking up to a decade or more to go public. With this shift in time horizons has come a shift in financing strategies and capital sources to fund them. Investors who used to invest in young public technology companies have been forced to invest in private companies instead. Long time horizons to liquidity has created large secondary markets for common stock. And finally, the shrinking number of public breakout companies (and public company founder role models) has created a founder generation skeptical of going public.
In this section we cover new sources of capital for late stage financings, secondary stock sales and tenders, and initial public offerings. I am not a lawyer and this is not intended to be legal advice so talk with your attorney about these topics.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"How to evaluate late-stage funding sources|Funding sources|As a later-stage company, you will have a broader set of investors to choose from than you did in the early days. If you are a high-growth company choosing from a strong crop of investors, consider the following factors when selecting a later-stage funder:
Follow-on capital. Some late-stage funds can deploy hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Is the fund able to follow on as you raise larger rounds?
Public market impact. Some public market investors, such as T. Rowe Price and Fidelity, send a strong positive market signal, as they are known as long-term holders of public equities. As you go public, they may hold your stock over the longer run, and this may impact your post-IPO perception and performance.
Note: At least one public market investor recently began publicly listing month-by-month changes in value in their private market portfolio (which makes no sense--can you really change a public company's valuation on a monthly basis?). This has caused issues for these companies in follow-on fundraises, secondaries, and employee morale.
Strategic value. Late-stage investors may have specific industry knowledge, partnership/introduction potential, or country-specific knowledge. For example, when entering the Chinese market, Uber originally set up a stand-alone subsidiary through which money was raised from Chinese funders who can help with government relations and other aspects of entering China. An investment from a strategic investor can also solidify a key partnership. For example, when Google signed the deal to power Yahoo! Search (at the time a company-making move), Google took an investment round from Yahoo!
Simple terms. Some late stage private equity firms or hedge funds ask for complex structures or extra liquidation preferences when doing investments. Terms may include additional issuance of shares under an IPO price, extra clawback of value during a sale under a certain price, and the like. If you are able to keep terms simple that is often worth the trade-off of also getting a lower valuation.
Board seats. A number of late-stage investors are willing to invest without taking a board seat--something DST pioneered. Avoiding a bloated board may become challenging as the number of rounds a company completes grows.
Ability to buy secondary stock or drive tenders. Some companies will couple a primary financing event (buying preferred stock) with a secondary sale or tender (allowing employees, founders, or early investors to sell part of their stake). Depending on the fund they may or may not have the appetite or the SEC registrations",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"How to evaluate late-stage funding sources|How DST revolutionized late-stage investing|The three biggest innovations in venture investing in the last 10 years include (in no particular order) (1) Y Combinator and the early-stage revolution, (2) AngelList Syndicates and distributed angel networks, and (3) DST and late-stage investing.
Yuri Milner and DST revolutionized late-stage investing by taking large stakes in a number of companies, starting with Facebook in 2009, with the following characteristics:
While this style of investing is now more commonplace, at the time DST entered the market with its Facebook investment its approach was quite radical. In those days, later-stage investors typically asked for complicated preferences, board seats, or other ways to control the company. A number of funds have since copied DST, but the firm seems to always be a step ahead of the rest with its global diversification and ability to cherry-pick some of the best companies and investments.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"How to evaluate late-stage funding sources|Key Terms|Late-stage financings are not that different from earlier-stage rounds for the key terms to consider. However, at the later stages the two most important items you'll weigh tend to collapse down to preference and board membership.
Preference. While top-tier early-stage investors tend to have a clean preference structure (i.e., non-participating preferred 1), private equity firms and family offices may ask for unusual preference structures that effectively convert an equity round into a debt round. For example, if the company and investor cannot agree on valuation, the private equity fund may ask for a 2X or 3X preference, as well as a ratchet on the next round. Similarly, later-stage investors may put in special provisions around IPOs (e.g., if the IPO prices under a certain valuation, or takes longer than six to nine months, the investor gets extra stock), future fundraises, or other aspects of the company's life cycle. In general, you should avoid these special terms if you can, although you may not have the chance to do so, especially if your valuation starts to exceed your core business metrics or capital is scarce.
Board membership. As with all financings, a key element to think through is whether or not to add a board member as part of the round. In general, larger boards are harder to manage. However, late-stage investors may bring a perspective to the board that has been lacking up to this point--around financial discipline, for example, or the state of the public market. This perspective can be helpful or destructive, depending on the board member and broader company context. On average, later-stage investors will be more numbers/revenue/margin driven, and this can drive a company down either a very good or a very bad path.
Additionally, later-stage investors may not be as used to dealing with the many ""oh shit"" moments that a startup typically faces in a rapidly evolving market, with a shifting product road map, and a changing org structure. Some late-stage investors are notoriously hands-off/founder-friendly (e.g., Yuri Milner and DST). However, many are used to ""safer"" late-stage investments and can cause trouble for a high-growth startup that's still rapidly evolving.
Choose your board members carefully! And consider avoiding new additions altogether, unless your late-stage investors can help in unique ways. Depending on the dynamics around your fundraise, you may not have a choice--e.g., if the investor requires a board seat and you do not have a good alternative option.
Before adding anyone as a board member, make sure to (1) do due diligence on her past investments and board seats; (2) have frank conversations about company direction and expectations; and (3) decide if there are other ways to give late-stage investors meaningful impact and access to company information--without adding a board seat. Alternatively, a late-stage investor may be able to add enormous value to your board and even help to clean out poorly performing early-stage investors. See the section on Removing Board Members for more information on this. 2",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Don't over-optimize your valuation|Valuation|A common temptation for founders is to raise money at the highest possible valuation. High valuations may help with employee recruitment and compensation, generate positive PR for a company, provide ammunition for M&A, and stoke founder egos. Unfortunately, too high a valuation can lead to a host of problems down the line. For example, for many of the unicorn companies, their ability to raise their next round has less to do with whether they are viable businesses, and more to do with the valuation at which they previously raised money. 1
Too high a valuation relative to the overall market can cause the following issues:
 1. Follow on fundraises become hard. Investors typically expect a 2-3X increase in valuation with each round. At very high valuations (e.g., billions) this decreases to a 50%-100% markup with each round. Nonetheless, adding $1 billion in market cap is actually a lot of value creation (revenue, user growth, etc.). The higher the valuation, the harder it is to grow % market cap.
2. Investor mix may shift. At high valuations the time horizons of the investors who will become involved may shift. Many of the non-traditional late stage investors who have entered private equity venture markets have a short time horizon of 18 to 24 months, and they may push for liquidity or progress in ways that may not be aligned with a company's ultimate goals.
3. Internal pressure to hit a target valuation causes bad behavior. This is a biggie which I will mention more below: The pressure a founder puts on herself with a high valuation may distort her behavior and cause her to lead her company down the wrong path.
4. Employee expectations. People who join the company due to the perceived value and upside of the stock will be upset if a down round occurs or the valuation does not grow in the next few years. This can also occur if the company valuation slides flat for three to four years while waiting to catch up to its valuation.
The above are all fundamentally issues of expectations. The higher your valuation, the higher the expectations. The worst manifestation of this is the pressure founders put on themselves when valuations are high.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Secondary stock sales|Selling stock|As your company's valuation continues to rise, early employees or investors may want to sell a subset of their stock in the company. A ""primary"" investment in a company is when you give a company money in exchange for its shares. A ""secondary"" investment is when you buy shares from someone besides the company (basically a previously owned share). In both cases, the shares could either be common stock or preferred stock. In other words, secondary stock is defined by who you are buying shares from versus the type of shares themselves.
For current or former employees, selling stock they hold may be driven by personal issues such as an expensive hospital bill for a family member, wanting to buy a house for themselves or their family, or an interest in diversifying what may be most of their net worth.
Early investors may be motivated to sell stock early by a need to return money to their funds' LPs (especially if they are in the process of raising another fund and want to show returns), or they may simply be looking out for their own financial interests and the need to generate ""carry"" on their funds. 1
Founders may also want to sell secondary stock to diversify their net worth, which is likely dominated by company stock. For that reason, founder sales, if done correctly, tend to align founders to focus on the long-term success or outcome of the company by taking away worries they may have about their personal financial future.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Secondary stock sales|$500 million to $1 billion tends to be a transition point|In general, a $500 million to $1 billion valuation is usually where founders and/or employees might start to consider selling stock. This shift in behavior is due to three factors: (1) It take two to five years to get to a $1 billion valuation. During that time life events (children, family illness, and the like) may have occurred and there is a financial need; (2) the market cap of the company is large enough that most of an individual's net worth is tied up in the company, 1% of the company may be worth $5 million or $10 million, diversifitcation starts to be meaningful. (3) Employee belief in the remaining multiple upside to the company may start to diminish. Almost all high-growth companies are chaotic and messy, and competition always increases when something is working well for a startup. Most early employees interpret this as a limit on the upside of the company, which increases their interest in selling. Moreover, the value of small amounts of stock at that valuation is sufficient to motivate employees to sell.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Secondary stock sales|Founder Sales|Founder secondary sales have become increasingly acceptable as a way to ensure that leaders continue to focus on the long-term potential of their companies, rather than sell early.
As an active founder, you may want to sell up to 10% of your holdings (or up to $5 to $10 million, whichever is lower) in a secondary transaction, as part of a round, a standalone sale, or a tender (more on each of those below). If you sell more than 10% (especially if you're still operationally involved with your startup), it will be perceived as a negative signal about your belief in the future of the company.
Most founder secondary sales occur once a company reaches a multi-hundred-million- dollar valuation. (There are some circumstances where smaller sales occur in the mid-to-high tens of millions if there is a specific founder need. In general, these earlier-stage sales amount to sales in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to pay off school debt or provide a small financial cushion for founders.)
Most founders I know are happy they took some amount of stock off the table to relieve financial pressures as the time to IPO keeps lengthening.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Types of secondary sales|Secondary Sales|In general, secondary sales begin as one-off sales--for example an employee needs to quit the company to take care of a sick parents and wants to sell some stock to pay for better medical care. As market cap grows and with it the demand to sell stock, the company realizes that random people are buying their way onto the cap table, or the demand to sell grows to significant levels as the company gets older and more employees and investors hold illiquid stock for multiple years. At this point, many companies switch to a ""preferred buyer"" or ""tender"" approach. I review the different types of secondary sales below:
1. One-off sales
In this scenario, the seller is executing a one-time transaction with either an existing cap table investor (i.e., someone who already owns company stock) or a new entity that is not already involved with the company. In general, the company has an incentive to push the stock seller to a buyer it already knows well.
There are ways to incentivize a seller to work with a known buyer. That includes everything from a simple request (especially if the seller is still active with the company as an employee or investor or wants to maintain a good relationship with the company) to making life difficult for the seller via the exercise of rights of first refusal (ROFRs) or other moves that delay the transaction and may destabilize it for the buyer and seller.
In general, one-off sales can backfire on a company as new, non-savvy, or potentially badly-behaved investors come on board. It is beneficial to the long-term health and stability of the company to establish a set of ""preferred buyers"" early to soak up secondary sales and demand for selling stock. This may be an informal relationship with trusted investors already on the cap table who want to buy more secondary. In parallel, the company should start to institute programs detailing how much employees or early investors can sell, and under what circumstances. Holding out the promise of a tender or other program will often cause potential sellers to wait for the company to initiate a formal secondary program. Most people want to do the right thing for the company, and are willing to wait 6-12 months, or more, for the opportunity to sell in a company-sanctioned manner.
2. Selling as part of a funding round
A straightforward time to sell--as a founder, early employee, or early investor--is during a funding round. Most financing rounds for late-stage breakout companies tend to be oversubscribed. The extra demand for company stock means that an investor who could not get a full primary allocation may be willing to take in a blend of preferred (as part of the round) and common stock (acquired from an employee or founder), or early-stage preferred stock (from an early investor).
Most late-stage investors will be okay with buying some secondary common stock alongside a preferred funding round, as the preferred stock helps protect the overall investment in a blended manner. Alternatively, investors who could not get a piece of a round may be willing to buy only common stock instead, depending on the structure of their funds. (Some funds cannot have a large portion of common stock in their portfolios due to LP agreements or the need for additional SEC filings.)
Most investors tend to discount common stock 20% to 30% relative to the preferred stock price--i.e., they will want to pay less for common stock since preference does not exist and will not protect them in a downside scenario. For example, when DST purchased secondary stock in Facebook it did so at a $6.5 billion valuation--a 35% discount on the $10 billion preferred price at the time. 1 However, if the company is hot enough, or the buyer hungry enough, investors may pay the same amount for common and preferred.
The company will likely want to take an arm's length approach to the common stock sale to avoid 409A implications (more on this below).",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Types of secondary sales|Secondary Sales|A large, company-sanctioned stock sale (and 409A re-analysis) could cause a repricing of common stock for the entire company (and future employee options), which is worth avoiding if possible. Talk with your lawyers about this.
Usually no more than 20% of the funding round will take place as secondary. The venture capitalists may not want to take the risk of buying too much common stock (which lacks the financial and control protections of preferred stock). There are also regulatory limits on the percentage a venture capital fund can invest in secondary versus primary stock.
3. Preferred buyer programs
In a preferred buyer program, one or more funds are given preferred access to purchase secondary stocks. These programs may be informal (e.g., the company suggests that potential sellers talk to a small number of funds) or formal (e.g., the company assigns a secondary ROFR, or right of first refusal, to these funds).
In a formal preferred buyer program, a fund may sign a term sheet, LOI, or binding agreement with a company to provide dedicated funds to soak up secondary stock. As part of this agreement, the fund can generally purchase stock in a pre-defined range (e.g., at a 10% discount to last round) and may be assigned a ROFR by the company.
The ROFR may become important: In many cases, the company has a 30-day right to purchase stock from a seller at a price the seller has negotiated with another buyer. When a ROFR is assigned to a fund, this may add a second 30-day period; if the company passes, the fund has another 30 days to purchase stock at the price the buyer has agreed to. The net effect is a 60-day--or more--delay between the statement of intent to sell and the time when a transaction can actually occur. This two-month timeframe can make buyers and sellers quite nervous, as market and other conditions may change during this time, destabilizing a secondary transaction.
In addition, a ROFR provides a source of sanctioned liquidity for a stock under a certain valuation, driving certain buyers out of the market: they cannot close a transaction, as the preferred buyer will take the sale from them. Effectively, the ROFR creates too long a wait and too high a price for many sellers, driving down market demand for secondary. You should talk to your legal team about ROFR assignments to preferred buyers.
Preferred buyer programs can be of special help when acquiring other companies. In this case, the founders or investors of the acquired company may want to sell a subset or all of the stock they receive in the transaction. A preferred buyer may help facilitate this transaction (and hence the actual acquisition) without the company itself needing to pay out cash as part of the purchase. This can also be handled via a tender, where the acquired company's investors can sell into a tender instead of a preferred buyer program.
4. Tender offers
A tender is basically a large coordinated event in which one or more buyers buy secondary stock in your company at a preset price.
Tender offers typically follow this pattern:
1. The company tries to estimate demand for a secondary stock sale. This determines the rough size of the tender. The company may also put in place paperwork to further restrict stock sales by people who participate in the tender.
2. The company signs a term sheet with a buyer or set of buyers to purchase stock in a tender offering. The buyers set a single price for all sellers.
3. The company determines who can sell into the tender. Often, prior and current employees, investors, and founders can participate in tenders. In some cases, the size of the tender is preset, and who can sell is set in an order determined by the company. For example, if there is a $50 million tender offering (in other words, $50 million of stock is sold in aggregate), the company may say that current and past employees get first dibs on selling up to 20% of their holdings each. If there is enough demand from employees to cover the full $50 million, then investors and founders do not get to sell into the tender.
4. An administrative institution is hired to administer the tender, as there may be hundreds or thousands of eligible sellers. That institution will deal with all the mechanics and paperwork to cover the sale of the stock by employees and other sellers. Banks or other institutions, such as Deutsche Bank, are often hired to run tenders, even though they are not the actual buyer of the stock. The cost of hiring these administrators is typically at least partially covered by a transaction fee paid by the sellers into the tender pay (e.g., 1% of their sale).
5. The set of people who can sell into the tender is notified that the tender is open, and told the price set for the stock purchase. They are also informed of the window of time in which eligible people can notify the administrator how much they want to sell and fill out the paperwork for a sale. The selling window may be open for 20 or 30 days.
6. Once the selling window closes, the transaction occurs and the stock and cash change hands.
Typically, buyers in a tender are large institutional buyers from the hedge fund, private equity, or late-stage VC worlds, such as BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, DST, Fidelity, and others.
Tender offers may range from the tens of millions into the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in size.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Investor sales: An opportunity to renegotiate|Selling Stock|As your valuation rises, early investors may want to sell all or a subset of their stock in your company. For example, an early angel may want to diversify or sell her stake, as your company's stock may be her biggest financial holding. Alternatively, a venture fund may want to sell part or all of its stake to return money to LPs, especially if they are raising their next fund and want to ensure the participation of those same LPs.
""In general, you should view investor secondary sales as an opportunity to claw back rights and clean up governance in a manner that is positive and mutually beneficial for all parties involved. ""
- Elad Gil
An investor's interest in selling stock also presents a key opportunity for you, an opening to renegotiate prior terms with that investor. Some key items you may want to revisit include:
Information rights. As an investor's stake diminishes, you can argue that they should no longer receive information rights if they have them. In some rare cases I have seen the biggest sources of leaks for companies have been early investors, rather than employees, trading favors with TechCrunch. Cleaning up early investor information rights can make a difference.
Board participation. Board representation is supposed to reflect ownership. Further, some early-stage investors are great advisors for a small ten-person company, but have no operating experience or insights for later-stage companies. As part of a secondary sale by a venture fund, you can ask that their board member step down, or you can convert her board seat into an independent seat from a preferred one. This returns control to the company and its founders and allows you to remove people from your board who are no longer helpful (or, in some cases, may be actively destructive). A large secondary sale to a preferred buyer or a tender is a unique opportunity to clean up the board, at least partially.
Cleaning up your cap table. A secondary tender may be an opportunity to clean up your cap table. For example, you can go to all your small, early angels and offer an ""all or nothing"" sale, where they can sell their entire stake or none of it. This may allow you to remove multiple line items from your cap table at once and consolidate them by selling their stock to a single investor with a bigger ownership stake.
In general, you should view investor secondary sales as an opportunity to claw back rights and clean up governance in a manner that is positive and mutually beneficial for all parties involved. The funds get to sell part of their stake and return money early to LPs, and the company gets to remove board members or information rights that have existed past their prime.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"409A and RSUs|Selling Stock|The key balance in secondary sales is to allow for such transactions to occur without impacting a company's 409A valuation for common stock strike price. The 409A is an analysis you do to set the price for your stock options. If large, company-sanctioned common stock transactions occur at high prices, you will need to reset your common strike price upward, impacting your ability to reward employees.
You should talk to your legal team about the right approach to secondary sales and 409A. In addition, you should consider moving to restricted stock units (RSUs) instead of options once your valuation is over $1 billion and you are within 18-36 months of going public.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"IPOs: Taking a company public|Going public|A common characteristic of companies from the 2007-2012 period is that many of them are focused on taking as long as reasonable to go public. While there are some drawbacks to being a public company, there are also a number of benefits.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"IPOs: Taking a company public|Benefits of going public|1. Employee hiring, retention, and conversion. Compensation packages at companies sometimes go down after an IPO, with a higher conversion rate of candidates to employees. In general, this is due to the employees valuing stock as a liquid currency, as well as the perceptual de-risking of the company. Retention goes up on newer employees (who have more future value in the company) and often will go down for old-timer employees (who may have made millions or tens of millions and are now liquid and able to leave). In general, the old-timer contingent will be small and likely to leave eventually anyway.
2. M&A. A liquid currency provides the ability to buy companies without haggling around what the acquirers stock is really worth.
3. New capital sources for the company. Public markets can provide outsized funding for companies after an IPO. For example, Tesla's ongoing rise may have been difficult to support without the broader based global capital flows of the public market. In a lose capital environment this seems like a minor point. In tight capital markets this can be the saving grace for a company. For example, Opsware went public in 2001 as private market sources had all dried up.
4. Ability to partner or sell at scale. A public company tends to be taken more seriously for partnerships, sales, and other business activities.
5. Fiscal & business discipline. When Facebook went public, monetization was viewed as a low priority for the company. After the first serious drop in stock price after an earnings call, Zuckerberg moved engineering and other resources into the ads team to scale monetization. An argument could be made that Facebook would never have reached a $500 billion as a private company. Public market pressure forced Facebook to re-examine its own priorities and led to a highly valued, liquid currency that could be used to acquire Instagram, WhatsApp, and other potential competitors.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"IPOs: Taking a company public|Cons of going public|1. Larger, more complex board of directors. Once you are public there are a number of committees you need to staff at the board level. This increases board size and complexity. Small boards tend to be more nimble.
2. Financial and other controls. As you prepare for the IPO a number of financial and process controls need to be instated. Some of these are actually a net positive for the company, but many don't help support the core business and just slow things down.
3. Employee mix shifts. As your company scales from 10 to 1,000 people, the risk profile of the people who join also changes. In general, the later stage the company the more risk averse the cohort of employees. Once a company goes public the hiring profile hits another transition. In general you will have the same overall caliber of people joining, however their risk profile will shift to more conservative. This can be actively managed or augmented by acquiring entrepreneurial companies and integrating them in culturally. Alternatively, the executive team and founders will need to encourage risk taking and rule questioning as part of the new culture.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"IPOs: Taking a company public|Market cycles|Many first time founders running high-growth, private companies today have not lived through a major economic and capital cycle. When the public markets collapse private markets tend to overreact. This is due to a few reasons:
1. Comparables. If public market valuations drop by 20-30%, private market valuations tend to follow. This is the difference between a billion dollar valuation and a $700M valuation. If companies raised at a high price while the markets were strong, they may need to do a down round when markets rebalance.
2. Venture and growth fund LP rebalancing. Many of the limited partners (endowments, family offices, pension plans) in venture and growth funds have a set limit on the percent of their capital that can be in venture capital. If there is a large public market shift, they need to reallocate capital out of venture capital--which means that funds can raise less money to invest in startups. This usually takes one to three years to take place as the typical venture fund lifecycle is two to three years.
3. Fear replaces greed. When people get scared they sit on their wallets.
In general, it is best to go public during an ongoing bull market. You can raise large amounts of capital and have a liquid currency by which to make acquisitions. The capital you raise in an up market allows you to survive, and act more aggressively in a down market. Amazon took advantage of being a public company masterfully. During the bubble in the 1990s they used their market cap to make a large number of acquisitions. As the bubble collapsed they used the large amounts of capital raised from public markets to sustain the company through the dark periods of the early 2000s.
As founders wait longer to go public, they may end up with extra hurdles or obstacles relative to their IPO price. This may include drops in public markets, unusual private market terms (for example needing to clear an IRR or IPO price hurdle in order to raise private capital), or simply raising at too high a valuation and then spending a few years hopefully growing into it.
While the 1990s were characterized by companies who went public too early, the 2010s perhaps had many companies that waited too long.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"M&A: Buying other companies|M&A|As your valuation increases, your stock may suddenly become a valuable currency with which to buy other companies. Many first-time CEOs or executive teams tend to shy away from acquisitions due to a lack of familiarity. If done right acquisitions can accelerate a company's product and hiring plan, as well as enable key strategic or defensive moves against competitors.
When I was at Twitter, the M&A team reported to me. I saw firsthand both the value of M&A as a strategic tool as well as the sheer number of startups that flounder and are looking for an acquirer (the failed startups no one ever talks about). While at Google, I was involved with the diligence, integration, or post-merger product management of a number of companies including Android (which became the well-known handset platform), Google Mobile Maps (originally a company called ZipDash), and the first Gmail client application (originally a company called Reqwireless).
M&A was a powerful tool for both Google and Twitter to add new products and key people as well as make major strategic moves. Similarly, Facebook has stayed at the leading edge (and acquired major market share) via its acquisitions of companies such as WhatsApp and Instagram, but also less famous companies like Snaptu, which drove major adoption of Facebook as a mobile client to over a hundred million people in the low- and middle-income world.
Most companies wait too long before making their first acquisition or are hesitant to use their stock as currency. Hopefully the information in this section will spark your M&A interest--and facilitate your ability to buy companies--early, rather than late, in your startup's growth.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Managing internal stakeholders|M&A|It is common for employees or executives at a company to push back on M&A. Pushing back on acquisitions may reflect a strategic or tactical insight. Alternatively, pushing back may reflect a lack of understanding or pragmatism about the inability of the company to do everything with the limited resources it has. Or, it may reflect jealousy around the acquisition price and financial outcome for the founders of the company you are buying. In general, more junior employees or company old-timers tend to push back more on M&A than experienced executives who have seen the value of doing acquisitions well at another company.
The set of companies you are looking to buy should be considered an internal secret and not something widely discussed with the entire company at an all-hands. This should be kept quiet because:
1. Word may leak. This can cause a number of bad scenarios including (i) competitive bids on the startup being acquired (ii) disruption of that company's operations--for example if one of your employees tells their friend at the company that you are thinking about buying them (iii) lobbying of regulators by your competitors to block the acquisition.
2. Most employees won't have context. Many of your employees may lack the broader strategic context, or experience, to understand how M&A may be used as a tool. They may also not understand that you may talk to ten companies but only buy one, and there is the potential for employees to get upset or worried about acquisitions that will never happen. Why cause organizational churn or questioning for no reason?
3. It makes it harder to bid on the same company again later. If you publically try to buy something, and then publically pass, it may become harder to justify to your team another attempt on the same company. Strategic imperatives, financial models or other items may change and it is best to maintain flexibility.
4. Members of your team may try to inappropriately block the acquisition. See below for common objections.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"Managing internal stakeholders|Dealing with objections|Common objections from the internal team may include:
1. Couldn't we just build this ourselves for cheaper? Why buy a small team with a nascent product for $20 million when that same $20 million could allow us to hire 100 people for a year?
Answers may include:
2. We are going to crush this competitor! Why would we buy them? In some cases it does not make sense to buy any competitors and to indeed outcompete everyone in the marketplace.

"M&A: How to set a valuation for companies you buy|Valuation factors to assess for all three types of M&A|Setting the right valuation for a company you plan to acquire is more art than science. Each type of acquisition comes with its own set of considerations as you set a valuation. However, there is also a common set of things to look at when determining your willingness to pay. What is the ""target's"" cash position? If they only have 3-6 months of cash left, they will not have a lot of time to negotiate, raise more money, or find other buyers.
How desperate are the founders or management team to sell? Founders and management teams can get tired. Do the founders want to exit? This was famously the motivation behind Flickr's exit to Yahoo!
Is the acquisition competitive? Who else might be bidding and what would they pay for it? If your stock is perceived as having more upside (e.g., if you are Airbnb at a $1 billion valuation), then you should be more financially convincing as an acquirer than Google (which is unlikely to increase its value by 10X again anytime soon).
Is the acquisition defensive? Is it important that you block someone else from buying the company, so you avoid their entry into your market? For example, Google's purchase of Waze may have been in part defensive, to prevent Facebook or Apple from entering mapping well.
How truly unique is the target you want to buy? If you are looking to buy a mobile team and there are a dozen of them running out of money, it is a different scenario than trying to buy Instagram, which is a one-of-a-kind asset.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"M&A: How to set a valuation for companies you buy|Team buys or aqui-hires|Team buys have a range of potential valuations depending on the following factors:
Team quality. How strong is the team? Do they come out of brand-name companies or schools? Have they launched or built awesome products in the past?
Unique expertise. Right after the iOS App Store launched, the value of mobile client developers was high and companies would pay a lot to buy these teams. Similarly, today Google and Facebook appear to pay large amounts for deep learning expertise. What expertise is your team missing that could move your company forward?
Acquirer desperation. Google paid through the nose to acquire ""social"" product managers, designers, and engineers during its Google+ heyday. Are there skill sets that your company desperately needs?
Celebrity cofounder or engineer. Does the prospective team have any well-known engineers, designers, businesspeople, or entrepreneurs on board? These ""celebs"" can help your company recruit exceptional talent once they are on your team. They may also have an outsized impact on your company due to their own personal networks or skill sets.
In general, on the low end, an acqui-hire means a 20% signing bonus to founders and standard salaries and packages for everyone else, with the cap table (i.e., the company's investors) getting no money back. This is more common than people think, and many touted and tweeted acquisitions turn out in reality to be hiring a subset of a team and shutting their company and product down.
For a true ""team buy,"" companies will typically pay $1 million to $3 million per engineer, designer, and product manager who ends up getting an offer to join. Businesspeople, operations, etc., are typically viewed as anything from a marginal bump in valuation to a potential negative if severance packages need to be generated for them. 1 Depending on how the acquisition is structured, much of the per engineer value may go to pay off the cap table (e.g., the $5 million invested by VCs in the company) or to retention packages for the team.
Most companies ask to interview the employees of a startup before making a team buy, and reserve the right to cut team members who do not meet the bar. This could reduce the final acquisition price further. In other words, you may drop the price on an acquisition if the target company's engineering talent is inconsistent in caliber and you only want a subset of the team to join your company. This is, as expected, a tough conversation to have. See more in the section on interviewing teams you acquire.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"M&A: Convincing someone (and their major investors) to sell|M&A|Beyond the generic valuation considerations mentioned above, you may also want to assess the following factors when considering a product buy:
How much time will this save us? What product hole will this purchase fill? Can the team be repositioned to fill this hole?
What is the estimated quantifiable impact of this purchase? For example, how many more users will this get us and what is the expected value per user we have? Or, how much more revenue or cash flow will this generate at what margin?
How will the strategic market landscape change if we make this purchase? Do we block a competitor's ability to do something? What does this enable us to do?
General rule of thumb for a product buy: You want employees of the target company to get at least a 20-50% bump in their compensation packages over what they could have gotten if they walked in off the street to interview with your company. Since they do not have a choice on where to go, paying them a little more up front discourages them from leaving your company two months later. Some of the early employees from a product or strategic buy may actually make dramatically more than this, so this is meant more as a ""worst-case"" scenario. There are two sorts of founders: those that want or need to sell and those that don't. In general, founders sell either due to fear and exhaustion (because they are tired, have run out of money, or are about to get crushed by a competitor) or conversely due to ambition and excitement (because they are excited about the impact they and their team will have, or about the financial payday).",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil
"M&A: Convincing someone (and their major investors) to sell|Convincing people to sell: Team & product buys|For team and product buys, you need to convince both the entrepreneurs and the investors 1 that selling to your company is a good idea. There is a different strategy to getting each on board.
If a founder is burned out or running out of money, not much convincing is needed--they will even try to sell you on the sale. If the entrepreneur does not need to sell, your main levers are:
Compensation. There are different ""levels"" of wealth in people's minds. They might include, for example, the ability to pay off school debt, the ability to buy a house, and the ability to never work again. In general, founders will react differently to $1 million in stock (""Wow, that's a lot of money! I can work for your company for a few years and then try again at a startup""), $5 million (""I can afford real estate in the Bay Area and not worry as much in life!""), and $10 million (""I probably do not need to work ever again"").
Depending on the entrepreneur, her financial status to date, and her personal history, different levels of wealth may be sufficient to convince some founders to sell irrespective of other factors. In general, stock and even cash payments will vest over one to four years, and in some cases stock the entrepreneur already earned will be re-vested.
Impact. What impact will the founders and their company or product have on your product and direction? Since you are starting to buy other companies, you are probably reaching millions or even hundreds of millions of people with your product. Can their product or vision overlap with yours so that they can influence the lives of millions of people?
Role. What role can you offer the founders and/or CEO? Will they have a larger team or even more influence than they did at their startup?
Threats. While I am not a big fan of this approach, some companies are famous for threatening startups they want to buy. They may file a lawsuit claiming IP infringement, or mention casually that they plan to enter the market, so the two companies may as well join forces. In most cases these are idle threats.
In a team or product buy, you will also need to convince investors to allow the sale to go through (assuming they can block it). Most investors want to see at least a 3X return on their investments on average. Of course, that means they need to do better than 3X on the ""winners"" to offset companies that shut down or return nothing to the investors. If your offer returns less than 3X their investment, investors may fight against the acquisition.
