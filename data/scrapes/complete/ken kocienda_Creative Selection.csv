"In deceptively brief terms, Edison tells us: “I make trial after trial until it comes.” He and his team were willing to perspire, but he also knew what he would be doing with all those hours: trial and error. For the lightbulb, filaments were the key, and bamboo was the most promising material, so Edison tested every kind of bamboo to find the best. If Burns is to be believed, there were twelve hundred varieties of bamboo, and Edison tried each one. It sounds simple, and it was, but the way Edison defined the project also gave it a shape. He crossed off items from a to-do list. When we made our porting strategy for the web browser, we turned to something like Edison’s model. We knew the compiler would tell us about broken cross-references, and we examined all of them one at a time. We knew our FIXMEs would tell us where our code was weakest, and we studied the reports closely. Moving toward the Black Slab Encounter was a stepwise process, much like Edison’s search for the best bamboo. Edison did trial after trial with filaments; we went file after file in our build process and FIXME after FIXME trying to load a web page. Both projects were built on unglamorous grunt work, but the specifics matter. Edison wasn’t just trudging toward the horizon in a desert, hoping that the crest of the next sand dune would reveal an oasis—that sounds more like the way that Don and I wandered through our browser investigations in the weeks before Richard joined us. Instead, Edison searched specifically for the best kind of bamboo, and he was undaunted by the need to check a vast number of varieties. Each one he tested was an item crossed off and brought him closer to finding which one was the best. In the lead up to the Black Slab Encounter, we did the same. Even though Don, Richard, and I struggled with the tedium, we kept plowing through each file and FIXME.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]

"We used the word “heuristics” to describe aspects of software development that tip toward the liberal arts. Its counterpart, “algorithms,” was its alter ego on the technical side. Heuristics and algorithms are like two sides of the same coin. Both are specific procedures for making software do what it does: taking input, applying an operation, and producing output. Yet each had a different purpose.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"Heuristics also have a measurement or value associated with them—the duration for an animation or the red-green-blue values for an onscreen color, but there isn’t a similar “arrow of improvement” that always points the same way. Unlike evaluating algorithms, heuristics are harder to nail down. For instance, how quickly should a scrolling list glide to a stop after you’ve flicked it? We always made demos to evaluate the possibilities.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"We used algorithms and heuristics like they were the left and right sides of our collective product development brain. Employing each involved an interplay of craft and taste, and we always tried to strike the correct balance. Algorithms and heuristics must coordinate to make a great high-tech product.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"it’s crucial to make the right call about whether to use an algorithm or a heuristic in a specific situation. This is why the Google experiment with forty-one shades of blue seems so foreign to me, accustomed as I am to the Apple approach. Google used an A/B test to make a color choice. It used a single predetermined value criterion and defined it like so: The best shade of blue is the one that people clicked most often in the test.

"Today, on the day I’m writing this introduction, hundreds of millions of people will use these Apple products, and if you count the browsers on Windows and Google Android that use code based on the Safari browser I helped develop, then the number of daily users runs to well over a billion, perhaps it’s closer to two. Yet we never thought about such big numbers. We were too busy focusing on small details.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"I have identified seven elements essential to Apple’s software success: Inspiration: Thinking big ideas and imagining what might be possible Collaboration: Working together well with other people and seeking to combine your complementary strengths Craft: Applying skill to achieve high-quality results and always striving to do better Diligence: Doing the necessary grunt work and never resorting to shortcuts or half measures Decisiveness: Making tough choices and refusing to delay or procrastinate Taste: Developing a refined sense of judgment and finding the balance that produces a pleasing and integrated whole Empathy: Trying to see the world from other people’s perspectives and creating work that fits into their lives and adapts to their needs There weren’t any company handbooks describing these elements. Nobody outlined this list in a new-employee orientation. There weren’t any signs affixed to the walls of our Cupertino campus exhorting us to “Collaborate!” On the contrary, we felt, on an instinctive level, that imposing a fixed methodology might snuff out the innovation we were seeking. Therefore, our approach flowed from the work. This happened from the top down, stemming from the unquestioned authority and uncompromising vision of Steve Jobs, and it happened from the ground up, through the daily efforts of designers and programmers you’ve never heard of, people like me and my colleagues, some of whom I’ll tell you about.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"While the seven essential elements are a distillation of what we did on an everyday basis, they represent long-term discovery too. An important aspect of this book is the way we built our creative methods as a by-product of the work as we were doing it. As all of us pitched in to make our products, we developed our approach to creating great software. This was an evolution, an outgrowth of our deliberate attention to the task at hand while keeping our end goal in mind. We never waited around for brilliant flashes of insight that might solve problems in one swoop, and we had few actual Eureka! moments. Even in the two instances in my Apple career when I did experience a breakthrough—more about these later—there certainly was no nude streaking across the Apple campus like Archimedes supposedly did. Instead, we moved forward, as a group, in stepwise fashion, from problem to design to demo to shipping product, taking each promising concept and trying to come up with ways to make it better. We mixed together our seven essential elements, and we formulated “molecules” out of them, like mixing inspiration and decisiveness to create initial prototypes, or by combining collaboration, craft, and taste to give detailed feedback to a teammate, or when we blended diligence and empathy in our constant effort to make software people could use without pulling their hair out. As we did all this mixing and combining of our seven essential elements, we always added in a personal touch, a little piece of ourselves, an octessence, and by putting together our goals and ideas and efforts and elements and molecules and personal touches, we formed our approach, an approach I call creative selection.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]

"Edison didn’t dream up the idea of electric lighting on his own, and carbon had been used in lightbulb filament investigations long before Edison started looking into its suitability—Joseph Swan experimented with carbon extensively. Yet such predecessors failed to create a practical lightbulb. Edison succeeded. Why? An adequate explanation must include Edison’s conception of electric lighting as a complex electric generation and distribution system, his already-established track record as an inventor, his ability to parlay his reputation into the necessary corporate funding for his investigations, and his vision to establish and lead one of the first product-oriented research and development labs, an organization that efficiently coordinated the efforts of many.5",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"I think Edison’s large-scale success was built on a foundation of tending to small details. I would like to turn the discussion back to how Edison himself described his approach for constructing the foundations for his innovative work, specifically, how he solved problems like finding the best filament material for his lightbulb: “None of my inventions came by accident.

"Don was the one who figured out how we would make our code quick. One day, a month or two after the Black Slab Encounter, he called me into his office and asked me to create a test program to measure browser speed. He envisioned an automated tool that would launch our browser app and command it to load a suite of web pages, one after the other, in rapid succession. Over the next couple days, I wrote the code to do just that. I named it the Page Load Test, but we soon took to calling the PLT.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"Before the PLT, our editorial process was primarily concerned with feature implementation, bug fixes, and web standards compliance—how well the browser did what it was supposed to do. These were all qualitative measures. The PLT checked for speed, a quantitative test, and it introduced an independent evaluation to every code change we made. Correctness and speed now went hand in hand. Don held that if we heeded the PLT without fail and rejected any code changes that made our code slower, only two things could happen. Either the browser would stay the same speed . . . or it would get faster. He would tap his index finger to his temple to punctuate his explanation of this sneaky logic. From the day the PLT was finished, Don declared, our browser would become faster by never getting slower. It was his Zen koan.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"There could be no exceptions to the PLT speed rule—Don wouldn’t allow it. When an essential bit of new code caused a slowdown, things could get tricky. Finding remedies for speed setbacks typically involved the prickly issue of software optimization",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"He had us carefully choose our optimization opportunities based on clear and provable knowledge about what was slow and hash things out right at the moment we found the slowness. The PLT helped us to correctly distribute optimization work throughout the entire project. We optimized when we knew what we were doing, in direct response to measuring code with the PLT.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"Sometimes, in the development of the browser, even our best investigations and “thinking outside the box” ideas weren’t sufficient. There were plenty of instances when we were about to integrate a new feature, only to find that there truly was no way to add the code without a negative impact on speed. As we introduced features like clicking the back button to return you to your previously viewed web page, we found we couldn’t perform the bookkeeping to maintain the previous page at quick readiness without impeding the load of all pages. The PLT showed the slowdown. When we deemed such features too important to skip but couldn’t figure out how to add them without causing such slowdowns, we instituted a trading scheme, where we found speedups in unrelated parts of our existing source code to “pay for” the performance cost of the new features. When we looked around for code to perform this kind of payoff optimization, we typically targeted code we knew well and that was stable, preferably both. Once found, we tuned this proxy code to function the same, only faster, and sufficiently faster that we wound up with either a nil or a positive net impact on performance when we added both the feature-laden code and the speed-payoff code to our project.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]

"If Don and I had continued working in the Eazel way at Apple, who knows when we would have had a demo to show? At that point in our careers, we simply didn’t know how to bootstrap a big project and set it on a course for success. Richard did. His demo was the lynchpin. He showed us that the Konqueror web browser could work on the Mac. He cut corners to highlight the potential of this code. Of course, Richard’s brilliant software shim made his breakthrough possible, but consider the conceptual framework he’d built around his plan and how he’d cornered all the difficulties of making a browser demo so that one piece of custom programming, his shim, was all that was left to close the circle. The cumulative effect created the illusion of a real browser even when only showing an incomplete portion of one.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"In the same way, software demos need to be convincing enough to explore an idea, to communicate a step toward making a product, even though the demo is not the product itself. Like the movie, demos should be specifically choreographed, so it’s clear what must be included and what can be left out. Those things that aren’t the main focus of a demo, but are required to create the proper setting, must be realized at the correct level of detail so they contribute to the whole rather than detract from the vision.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"The font rendering was not to Apple standards—some characters were jaggy rather than smooth—but text was legible enough, so Richard expended no more effort on typography.

He chose this combination of important/passable/ignorable features carefully to maximize impact, minimize distractions, and fit the work schedule he’d set for himself.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]

"computer programs are much like cookbook recipes. Both offer specific directions to accomplish a task. Yet, while chefs write their cookbooks to be read by people, programmers can’t write for computers in the same way, because computers don’t natively comprehend programming languages. Computers speak a binary language of 0s and 1s, so to get a computer to perform my job, I have to convert my C++ code into a computer-consumable binary form using a program called a compiler. This conversion process of human-readable to machine-runnable is called compilation or building. This translation procedure also explains why lines of code written in a programming language are called source code. They’re the source material a compiler builds into (i.e., translates into) binary code the computer can execute.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"What can explain this difference? On the surface, much appears to hinge on Richard’s programming feat, his software shim. Otherwise, his effort with Konqueror seems much like my struggles with Mozilla. Perhaps he was just a better programmer than me, and without his coding cleverness, there would be no story. That explanation is too simple. Richard made his shim only after determining he needed one last link in a chain of inspiration, intuition, reasoning, and estimation. His shim was a consequence of his overall plan. To show what I mean, here’s an accounting of what Richard did in his first couple of days at Apple. He began by quizzing us on the browser analysis we had done before his arrival, and after hearing it, he quickly discarded our effort with Mozilla as unlikely to bear fruit. By doing so, he demonstrated the self-confidence to skip any ingratiating display of deference to his new manager, a person who had years of experience in the technical field he was newly entering. Next, Richard resolved to produce a result on the shortest possible schedule. He downloaded an open source project that held genuine promise, the Konqueror code from KDE, a browser that might well serve as the basis for our long-term effort. In getting this code running on a Mac, he decided to make the closest possible approximation of a real browser that was feasible on his short schedule. He identified three features—loading web pages, clicking links, and going back to previous pages. He reasoned these alone would be sufficiently compelling proofs of concept. He then made his shortcuts, and these simplifying choices defined a set of nongoals: Perfect font rendering would be cast aside, as would full integration with the Mac’s native graphics system, same for using only the minimum source code from KDE. He reasoned that these shortcuts, while significant, would not substantially detract from the impact of seeing a browser surf web pages. He resolved to draw together these strands into a single demo that would show the potential of Konqueror. Then, finally, he worked through the technical details, which led him to develop his software shim, since that was the only thing standing between him and the realization of his plan. His thought process amplified his technical acumen. In contrast, Don and I were hoping Mozilla would pan out somehow. I was trying to get the open source behemoth to build on the Mac, with little thought beyond that. I had no comparable plan, goals, nongoals, tight schedule, or technical shortcuts.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"How long should it take for an app icon to animate up from its place on the home screen to fill the entire display? How far should you have to drag your finger on the screen for it to be possible to interpret the touch as a swipe gesture? How much should a two-finger pinch gesture allow you to zoom in on an image in the Photos app? The answers to all of these questions were numbers, and might be 0.35 seconds for the app animation, or 30 pixels for the swipe gesture, or 4x for photo zooming, but the number was never the point. The values themselves weren’t provably better in any engineering sense. Rather, the numbers represented sensible defaults, or pleasing effects, or a way to give people what they meant rather than what they did. It takes effort to find what these things are, which is appropriate, since the etymological root of “heuristic” is eureka, which (of course) comes from the Greek and means “to find.” This is where that word, “eureka,” actually figured into our development process, since good heuristics don’t come in brilliant flashes, but only after patient searches, and it wasn’t always clear to us that we had found the right heuristic even when we had. We arrived at our final decisions only with judgment and time. Heuristics are like this.

"One legend swirls more persistently around the QWERTY design than all others: how its inventor developed the arrangement to slow down typists. This is correct, as far as it goes, but it focuses on the wrong thing. Given the limits of nineteenth-century technology and the need for a complex scheme to actuate a series of metallic keys to strike a page, a major problem was developing a system where the keys didn’t jam. The time it took to clear key jams was the real bane of speedy typists, so QWERTY was an excellent compromise between an efficient key arrangement for people’s fingers and the need for a typing apparatus to whirl and clack. The QWERTY layout actually helped people type faster.4",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]

"Whatever it was, the concrete and specific modifications we chose to make led to the actions items that justified making the next demo. Repeat, then repeat again.

Steve was at the center of all the circles. When he was in sufficiently good health—he had returned only a couple months earlier from his second health-related leave of absence in five years—he made all the important product decisions. He used these demo reviews as his chief means of deciding how Apple software should look and feel and function.,Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"A small group of passionate, talented, imaginative, ingenious, ever-curious people built a work culture based on applying their inspiration and collaboration with diligence, craft, decisiveness, taste, and empathy and, through a lengthy progression of demo-feedback sessions, repeatedly tuned and optimized heuristics and algorithms, persisted through doubts and setbacks, selected the most promising bits of progress at every step, all with the goal of creating the best products possible.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"For software developers who take their work seriously, Knuth is the consummate craftsman. Here’s what he has to say about optimization: Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.2 (Emphasis added.)",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"The PLT helped us to understand what our programming instructions were doing along the essential axis of speed and showed us precisely when and where we were introducing slowness to our source code. The PLT told us when to pay attention to the “small efficiencies” Knuth mentioned. It was our 3 percent escape hatch, a way to know for sure that optimization wasn’t “premature.” We were sure each optimization we did was helping to keep performance heading in the right direction.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"When I make a demo, I think about the intended audience, and I make a specific decision about what features to include. I draw a conceptual ring around those key details, and I use a thick imaginary marker to do it. The demo points inside the ring are the focus, and like the lamppost in the movie scene, I depict them with the highest fidelity. I leave outside the ring other less important details that will eventually have to be addressed, but not immediately. I pay them as little attention as possible.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"Over time, Don and I began to understand and absorb the model Richard showed us. Look for ways to make quick progress. Watch for project stalls that might indicate a lack of potential. Cut corners to skip unnecessary effort. Remove distractions to focus attention where it needs to be. Start approximating your end goal as soon as possible. Maximize the impact of your most difficult effort. Combine inspiration, decisiveness, and craft to make demos.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"as part of a 2003 New York Times interview discussing the iPod, Steve drove his point home: Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it [a product] looks like. People think it’s this veneer—that the designers are handed this box and told, “Make it look good!” That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.7 His message is clear, and I agree with it. Shallow beauty in products doesn’t serve people. Product design should strive for a depth, for a beauty rooted in what a product does, not merely in how it looks and feels. Form should follow function, even though this might seem like a strange notion for pixels on a screen, but it’s not if you believe the appearance of a product should tell you what it is and how to use it. Objects should explain themselves.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]

"Over time, I decided many different data sets merited inclusion: sports team and stadium names, city names, product names, chat slang, abbreviations, and more.

"In the end, these tech talks inspired me more than they directly informed my algorithms. Honestly, much of the math they described was beyond me. I’m not an engineer by training—in fact, I never took a single math course in college. If there ever was an argument that I should have kept studying the subject beyond high school because there was no telling when I might need it, this was it. I was in over my head. Yet I wasn’t completely lost. When Richard Williamson joined Apple and helped us determine the technical direction for our web browser project, he showed that it was possible to make technical headway by skipping past the problems he couldn’t solve in favor of those he could. So, that’s what I did.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"When you tapped the zoom button on our iPad demo, the keyboard you were looking at (say, mine) transitioned to the other one (his), much like clicking to go to the next slide in presentation software like Keynote or PowerPoint. The image of one keyboard disappeared to nothingness to reveal the other underneath. Bas added scaling to his animation—the keys of the departing keyboard changed size to match the one coming into view. He also tuned the timing of the animation, so it started slowly and sped up as it went, making you feel you had definitively landed once the animation finished. These effects were subtle, given that his animation was a mere fraction of a second, but Bas had a way of making these details count. When you looked at this zoom key animation, it appeared as if the keyboards were undergoing a complex morph. They weren’t. From an engineering perspective, this was significant, since the simplicity of the design meant I could write the code for his animation in just a couple hours. The magic was in the overall effect. The animation didn’t look like clicking from one slide to another in a presentation deck. When you tapped on the zoom button, it made you feel like one keyboard was becoming the other. The effect registered viscerally. It was exactly the kind of self-explanatory touch that made Apple software easy to use.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]

"Demo reviews were also part of Steve’s effort to model the product development behaviors he wanted us to use when he couldn’t be present. As in Diplomacy, the whole software organization kept meetings and teams small to maintain efficiency and to reinforce the principle of doing the most with the least. Steve’s constant demand to see a succession of demos spawned numerous other demos, each with their own presenters and deciders. All these demos helped the entire software team stay focused on making great products.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"Algorithms produce quantifiable results, where progress is defined by measurements moving in a predetermined direction, as in the case of the nearly yearlong effort to improve the performance of Safari.

This was never in question. Faster times were better.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"Although Steve’s opinions and moods could be hard to anticipate, he was utterly predictable when it came to his passion for products. He wanted Apple products to be great, and he insisted on being involved in the process as it went along, to guide the development of the work through his reviews.

"If indeed we had that chance, we fumbled it. We never lived up to any of our lofty goals. Chief among our missteps was failing to conceive of our software as a single product instead of as a set of separate projects. We never figured out how to integrate the pieces. Nothing worked smoothly. Our software update feature was riddled with bugs that often broke programs while trying to update them. Our code to connect Nautilus to our cloud services didn’t work at all. The Nautilus team had persistent problems coordinating with GNOME—the loose structure and lack of profit motive of the free software community meant that they did not share our money-making goals or care to coordinate with us so we could meet our delivery schedules. All these setbacks caused delay after delay.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]

"However, in the early phase of software development, it’s possible to shake free of these restrictions, especially when teams are small and the hunt for ideas is still on. This was the scenario when Richard joined us at Apple. We were still looking for an organizing concept to kick-start our web browser effort, and Richard showed us how. Not only that, he proved that a 10x productivity gap is a conservative upper limit on the possible in early stage software. Indeed, Richard did more to move our project ahead in two person-days of work than Don and I had done in the preceding twelve person-weeks. That’s more like a 30x gap.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"With our Darwinian demo methodology, we had a huge advantage over artificially selecting breeders and the glacially slow accumulations of genetic improvements that drive natural selection. Working in software meant we could move fast. We could make changes whenever we wanted, and we did. We created new demos that were concretely and specifically targeted to be better than the previous one. We constructed Hollywood backlots around these demos to provide context and to help us suspend our disbelief about the often nonexistent system surrounding the feature or app that was the focus of our attention. We gave each other feedback, both as initial impressions and after living on the software to test the viability of the ideas and quality of the associated implementations. We gathered up action items for the next iteration, and then we forged ahead toward the next demo. I’ve given a name to this continuing progression of demo -> feedback -> next demo: creative selection.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"There are innumerable ways creative selection can become bogged down, since this working method must be applied consistently over a period of time to yield results. Consequently, our success was as much about what we didn’t do as what we did. Mostly we avoided falling into any of the typical product development traps common in Silicon Valley and that, I expect, occur often in other kinds of creative organizations and businesses. For example, we didn’t take two-hour coffee breaks or hold daylong offsite confabs to talk about projects without examples to ground the discussion—we didn’t have lengthy discussions about whose imaginary puppy was cuter. We didn’t shuffle around printed specifications or unchanging paper mock-ups for weeks on end, waiting for an epiphany that would jump us directly from an early-stage concept to a complete product design, hoping we could somehow flip the ratio of inspiration to perspiration Thomas Edison spoke about, the relationship between the time it takes to get an idea and the amount of hard work it takes to transform that idea into something real.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]

"We managed to steer clear of all such pitfalls. If I were to take a stab at explaining the why, I would say that our clarity of purpose kept us on track, in much the same way that Vince Lombardi won football games and Steve Jobs pushed us to make a speedy first version of Safari. Since our focus on making great products never wavered—if for no other reason than that’s what Steve demanded—perhaps concentrating keenly on what to do helped us to block out what not to do.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"The Intersection,” the title of this chapter, was an idea that helped us. It speaks to the way Apple valued expertise in both technology and liberal arts.

We hoped to make our products meaningful and useful to people.",Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs,Ken Kocienda,[]
"The reason that Apple is able to create products like the iPad is because we’ve always tried to be at the intersection of technology and liberal arts, to be able to get the best of both, to make extremely advanced products from a technology point of view, but also have them be intuitive, easy to use, fun to use, so that they really fit the users.
