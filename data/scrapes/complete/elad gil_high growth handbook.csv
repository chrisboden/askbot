"In fact, the general model for successful tech companies, contrary to myth and legend, is that they become distribution-centric rather than product-centric. They become a distribution channel, so they can get to the world. And then they put many new products through that distribution channel.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"How to build a strong culture44 1. Have strong hiring filters in place. Explicitly filter for people with common values. You need to be careful that this does not act as a mechanism to inadvertently filter out diverse populations. You can have both a common sense of purpose and a diverse employee base at the same time. See later sections and the interview with Joelle Emerson for more information. 2. Constantly emphasize values day-to-day. Repeat them until you are blue in the face. The second you are really sick of saying the same thing over and over, you will find people have started repeating it back to you. 3. Reward people based on performance as well as culture. People should be rewarded (with promotions, financially, etc.) for both productivity and for living the company’s values. 4. Get rid of bad culture fits quickly. Fire bad culture fits even faster than you fire low performers.45 This chapter focuses on #1 above:",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"Often, CEOs try to find early employees a place where they won’t do much harm, versus a place they will excel. If you find yourself thinking this way, 99% of the time the right answer is to part ways with the early employee. You can let them go with grace and they may be relieved to be free to do something new.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"Sometimes that gets confused, though, because the group thinks they’re the decision-maker and that the goal is consensus. When really the goal is, “Let’s hash it out together. We may not all agree. One person will be the decision-maker, and then we will all commit to it.” If you don’t clarify what kind of decision this is, then groups really struggle because their expectations are not set correctly.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
Bill Gates famously said that he often hired senior executives so that he could learn from them.,High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
If you don’t keep innovating—your product will go stale. And somebody will come out with a better product and displace you.” —Marc Andreessen,High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"If you don’t start layering in HR once you’ve passed 50 people on your way to 150, something is going to go badly wrong. I think there’s actually an explanation for that. It’s because 150 is the Dunbar number, the number of people you can directly know. So somewhere between 50 to 150 people, everybody doesn’t know everybody. There are people running around who other people have never met. When you were 5 or 10 or 20 people, it was one big happy family and everybody knew everybody—well, maybe it wasn’t, but at least everybody knew everybody. And the CEO had direct one-on-one relationships with everybody in the company. Once you get to 50+, that’s just no longer the case.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"You obviously want as much defensibility as you can get in your product, and so you try to get as far out ahead as you can. It’s the idealized Peter Thiel model of “build something nobody else can build.” Or the SpaceX model of “go get all the talent.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"My product is magical and nobody can replicate it, and I need to price it like it’s a commodity.” No, you don’t. In fact, quite the opposite. If you price it high, then you can fund a much more expensive sales and marketing effort, which means you’re much more likely to win the market, which means you’re much more likely to be able afford to do all the R&D and acquisitions you’re going to want to do.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"I think network effects are great, but in a sense they’re a little overrated. The problem with network effects is they unwind just as fast. And so they’re great while they last, but when they reverse, they reverse viciously. Go ask the MySpace guys how their network effect is going. Network effects can create a very strong position, for obvious reasons. But in another sense, it’s a very weak position to be in. Because if it cracks, you just unravel. I always worry when a company thinks the answer is just network effects. How durable are they?",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"In most business books, the role of the CEO boils down to a small number of key responsibilities. The CEO: Sets the overall direction and strategy of the company and communicates this direction regularly to employees, customers, investors, etc. Hires, trains, and allocates company employees against this overall direction while maintaining company culture. Raises and/or allocates capital against this overall direction. Acts as chief psychologist of the company. Founders are often surprised by the extent to which people and organizational issues start to dominate their time.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
Key components of personal time management include: Delegation. Auditing your calendar regularly. Saying no more often. Realizing your old way of operating will no longer work. Finding time for the things you care about in life.,High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
1. Hire an experienced manager to run a team and watch how she does it.,High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"2. Trial and error. Try delegating and try again until it works. This will be part of any approach you take. You need to build some pattern recognition for when someone is starting to flail (they seem overworked and rumpled, they’re late to every meeting, etc.) or when people have more slack in their time. You will learn to iterate on the size of responsibilities, teams, or projects you give someone and build confidence in their skills as they continue to add to their stack.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
You will notice she probably tends to hold regular 1:1s (to stay in sync with her team) while also trying to give the most rope to the team members who run most independently.,High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"3. Get a formal or informal mentor. Ask a board member, angel, fellow entrepreneur, or executive you trust to mentor you on management and delegation. Alternatively, assemble a set of CEOs whose companies are at the same stage as yours, and meet them regularly for dinner so you can compare notes—you can learn a lot from your peers.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"However you choose to learn this skill, you’ll also need to watch out for key signs that you are not delegating the way the CEO of a high-growth company needs to: You tend to leave meetings with many action items for yourself. Someone now “owns” an area you used to run, but after 4-8 weeks you find you are still doing most of the work or weighing in on every decision, however small. You feel the need to jump in on every email thread or attend every meeting across the company.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"A CEO’s energy levels dictate those of the team. You should find time to take vacations and truly be offline—otherwise you will lose energy, burn out, and potentially give up. This means once a year you should take a real one- to two-week vacation, and every quarter you should take a three-day weekend. If you are working every day, I strongly suggest that you start enforcing a personal no-work day at least once a week. Burning out will not help you or your company deal with all the stresses of scaling.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"If you end up working long hours on things you fundamentally couldn’t care less about, you should consider hiring one or more executives (or a COO) to do all those things on behalf of the company.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"2. Once you are at about 30 people, you should hold a weekly staff meeting. Schedule a regular weekly time. Review key metrics. Be ready with a set of key topics for discussion on broader company or product strategy or key issues a functional area faces. Different members of the staff can present on a specific key topics or issue each week. Note: this is not meant to be an opportunity for team members to give an in-depth update once a week—it is a forum for discussion of metrics and strategy. Remember the purpose of the meeting may be more for your reports then for you. While you have context on what every executive is doing, the other executives will not otherwise have clarity into their peers’ organizations. The weekly staff meetings are meant to create a forum for knowledge sharing and issue raising, relationship building, collaboration, and strategy.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
You do not want to preserve culture; you want to collectively steer the right evolution of the culture.” —Patrick Collison,High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"I think there are five top responsibilities of a CEO: being the steward of and final arbiter of the senior management; being the chief strategist; being the primary external face for the company, at least in the early days; almost certainly being the chief product officer, although that can change when you’re bigger; and then taking responsibility and accountability for culture.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"One of the things you should always ask is, ‘If this person joined my company, would you join?’” —Keith Rabois",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"For some roles, the best way to assess a candidate (outside of direct prior knowledge working with them) is to have them develop a work product as part of the interview. This could happen either onsite or as a take home. For example, an engineer could do a coding exercise, or a designer could be asked to do a quick set of wire frames or workflow for a hypothetical product. A marketing person could be asked to generate a hypothetical product marketing plan. In general, it is good to avoid asking for work or output on an existing company product to avoid the perception of getting free labor out of a candidate.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"Design: Design the optimal visual and user experience for the product. Engineering: Build the product. Suggest how the technical road map can drive product and vice versa. Product: Set the product vision and road map and ensure the company builds a product that the user needs. Make trade-offs and prioritize between design, engineering, and business concerns.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"Every company I have ever worked for, or with, has realized that one of the biggest determinants of candidate conversion is how quickly you interview them and how quickly you can make an offer.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"This means once a year you should take a real one- to two-week vacation, and every quarter you should take a three-day weekend. If you are working every day, I strongly suggest that you start enforcing a personal no-work day at least once a week.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"Another lesson that I learned from Brian Chesky—one way to think about when to upgrade executives—is that a really great executive is about six to twelve months ahead of the curve. They’re already planning for and acting on things that are going to be important six to twelve months in the future. A decent executive is delivering in real time, now to one to three months in advance.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"Keith: The traditional advice derives from High Output Management—you know, Andy Grove in 1982—which is at most seven. Or five. Five or seven. The reason why is that you want to do a certain number of 1:1s at a weekly pace, and you want to do about one a day. So that means five or seven or something like that. I think if you can get down to three to five, that’s ideal. If you have to go four to seven, that’s definitely possible to scale. So anywhere in those ranges can work.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"There are a lot of things that are urgent but not important. The hard part of being a good CEO is that you have to be willing to let some things fall apart. You don’t have enough time to do everything well. And in practice, what that means is that there are some urgent things that you just don’t do. Getting comfortable with that takes a long time. It’s hard.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"The people who are thriving—at any level, junior to senior—tend to have people approaching their desk all the time.” —Keith Rabois",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"All startup advice is only useful in context, and I am a firm believer that the only good generic startup advice is that there is no good generic startup advice. So take what is written here with a grain of salt—it is very much one person’s experiences,",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"Sam: I think the biggest change people fail to make is that at some point your job becomes more about hiring people and working with them to get what you want done than doing it yourself. The number one failure to scale that we see in CEOs is the failure to make that transition. You need to be conscious as it’s happening, and realize that at some point you’ll get far more leverage on your time if you hire people and work with them closely than try to do everything yourself. And that’s a hard transition for many CEOs to make.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"am also an investor in a number of breakout or high-growth companies: Airbnb, Coinbase, Gusto, Instacart, OpenDoor, Pinterest, Stripe, Square, Wish, and others. In some cases I have helped companies in meaningful ways, in others I have been a mere observer along for the ride.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"You want someone who will come in to complement, operationalize, and execute your vision as a founder.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"Aaron: I think it doesn’t make sense until there’s some sort of inflection from a growth standpoint. The idea is not to hand a COO random busywork from around the company. Instead, consider some key criteria: Are you scaling at a rate where your own time is now spent primarily on pure operational activities—like hiring and building up goal-setting structures and performance reviews and helping people with organizational issues and process? Is that pulling you away from things like your product strategy and product design or working with customers, for instance? You have to solve all those problems either way, and at some point in the inflection curve, it just makes more sense to get a partner to help you with the operational stuff.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"I ended up realizing that it was actually just my job to make sure that we got all of the problems solved, not that I had to personally solve them all.” —Aaron Levie",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
"told them that I’m not going to tell you which operating processes you should put in place. But I will tell you that you need them, and you need them sooner than you realize. The analogy I drew was to games, or sports. I said, “You know why playing a game is fun? Because it has rules, and you have a way to win. Picture a bunch of people showing up at some athletic field with random equipment and no rules. People are going to get hurt. You don’t know what you’re playing for, you don’t know how to win, you don’t know how to score, and you don’t know what the objectives are.” Everyone was nodding along—and this is a 40-person startup—but I could tell that they’re struggling, because they don’t really have any core goals. They’re definitely in a product/market-fit, find-our-way mode, so I don’t think they should have anything too heavy. But organizations need constraints and objectives to optimize against, so that people can actually independently make decisions.",High Growth Handbook,Elad Gil,[]
