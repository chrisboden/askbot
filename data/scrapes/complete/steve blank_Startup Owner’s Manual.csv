"Customer discovery includes two outside-the-building phases. The first tests customer perception of the problem and the customer’s need to solve it. Is it important enough that the right product will drive significant numbers of customers to buy or engage with the product?

When customers enthusiastically confirm the importance of both the problem and the solution, customer discovery is complete.",The Startup Owner's Manual: The Step-By-Step Guide for Building a Great Company,Steve Blank,[]

"Rather than asking customers explicitly about feature X, Y or Z, one approach to defining the MVP is to ask, “What is the smallest or least complicated problem that the customer will pay us to solve?” This approach runs counter to the typical cry for more features, which is often based on what the competitors have or what the last customer visited had to say. The MVP is the inverse of what most sales and marketing groups ask of their development teams.",The Startup Owner's Manual: The Step-By-Step Guide for Building a Great Company,Steve Blank,[]
