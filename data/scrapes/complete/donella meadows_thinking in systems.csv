"The most damaging example of the systems archetype called “drift to low performance” is the process by which modern industrial culture has eroded the goal of morality. The workings of the trap have been classic, and awful to behold. Examples of bad human behavior are held up, magnified by the media, affirmed by the culture, as typical. This is just what you would expect. After all, we’re only human. The far more numerous examples of human goodness are barely noticed. They are “not news.” They are exceptions. Must have been a saint. Can’t expect everyone to behave like that. And so expectations are lowered. The gap between desired behavior and actual behavior narrows. Fewer actions are taken to affirm and instill ideals. The public discourse is full of cynicism. Public leaders are visibly, unrepentantly amoral or immoral and are not held to account. Idealism is ridiculed. Statements of moral belief are suspect.

"The world peeps, squawks, bangs, and thunders at many frequencies all at once. What is a significant delay depends—usually—on which set of frequencies you’re trying to understand.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
"Because we bump into reinforcing loops so often, it is handy to know this shortcut: The time it takes for an exponentially growing stock to double in size, the “doubling time,” equals approximately 70 divided by the growth rate (expressed as a percentage).",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,"['economics', 'feedback-loop', 'rule-of-72']"
"There always will be limits to growth. They can be self-imposed. If they aren’t, they will be system-imposed.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
"The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system's behavior.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
"System: A set of elements or parts that is coherently organized and interconnected in a pattern or structure that produces a characteristic set of behaviors, often classified as its “function” or “purpose.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
"we sometimes miss seeing that we can fill a bathtub not only by increasing the inflow rate, but also by decreasing the outflow rate.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
"Everything we think we know about the world is a model. Every word and every language is a model. All maps and statistics, books and databases, equations and computer programs are models. So are the ways I picture the world in my head—my mental models. None of these is or ever will be the real world. Our models usually have a strong congruence with the world. That is why we are such a successful species in the biosphere. Especially complex and sophisticated are the mental models we develop from direct, intimate experience of nature, people, and organizations immediately around us. However, and conversely, our models fall far short of representing the world fully. That is why we make mistakes and why we are regularly surprised. In our heads, we can keep track of only a few variables at one time. We often draw illogical conclusions from accurate assumptions, or logical conclusions from inaccurate assumptions. Most of us, for instance, are surprised by the amount of growth an exponential process can generate. Few of us can intuit how to damp oscillations in a complex system.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
The presence of stocks allows inflows and outflows to be independent of each other and temporarily out of balance with each other.,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
Most individual and institutional decisions are designed to regulate the levels in stocks.,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
It is the consistent behavior pattern over a long period of time that is the first hint of the existence of a feedback loop.,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
"The more output that is produced, the more can be invested to make new capital. This is a reinforcing loop, like the birth loop for a population. The investment fraction is equivalent to the fertility. The greater the fraction of its output a society invests, the faster its capital stock will grow.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
"If we’re to understand anything, we have to simplify, which means we have to make boundaries.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
"As we try to imagine restructured rules and what our behavior would be under them, we come to understand the power of rules. They are high leverage points. Power over the rules is real power.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
The structure of a commons system makes selfish behavior much more convenient and profitable than behavior that is responsible to the whole community and to the future.,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]

"One promising way of redefining the meaning of ‘economist’ is to look to those who have gone beyond new economic thinking to new economic doing: the innovators who are evolving the economy one experiment at a time. Their impact is already reflected in the take-off of new business models, in the proven dynamism of the collaborative commons, in the vast potential of digital currencies and in the inspiring possibilities of regenerative design. As Donella Meadows made clear, the power of self-organisation—the ability of a system to add, change and evolve its own structure—is a high leverage point for whole system change. And that unleashes a revolutionary thought: it makes economists of us all. If economies change by evolving, then every experiment—be it a new enterprise model, complementary currency or open-source collaboration —helps to diversify, select and amplify a new economic future.",Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist,Kate Raworth,[]
"Dynamic systems studies usually are not designed to predict what will happen. Rather, they’re designed to explore what would happen, if a number of driving factors unfold in a range of different ways.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
"Carter also was trying to deal with a flood of illegal immigrants from Mexico. He suggested that nothing could be done about that immigration as long as there was a great gap in opportunity and living standards between the United States and Mexico. Rather than spending money on border guards and barriers, he said, we should spend money helping to build the Mexican economy, and we should continue to do so until the immigration stopped. That never happened either.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]

"Physical structure is crucial in a system, but is rarely a leverage point, because changing it is rarely quick or simple. The leverage point is in proper design in the first place.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]

"The most effective way of dealing with policy resistance is to find a way of aligning the various goals of the subsystems, usually by providing an overarching goal that allows all actors to break out of their bounded rationality.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]

A diverse system with multiple pathways and redundancies is more stable and less vulnerable to external shock than a uniform system with little diversity.,Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
"Serious problems have been solved by focusing on external agents—preventing smallpox, increasing food production, moving large weights and many people rapidly over long distances. Because they are embedded in larger systems, however, some of our “solutions” have created further problems. And some problems, those most rooted in the internal structure of complex systems, the real messes, have refused to go away.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
"According to the competitive exclusion principle, if a reinforcing feedback loop rewards the winner of a competition with the means to win further competitions, the result will be the elimination of all but a few competitors. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]

"You can see some things through the lens of the human eye, other things through the lens of a microscope, others through the lens of a telescope, and still others through the lens of systems theory. Everything seen through each kind of lens is actually there. Each way of seeing allows our knowledge of the wondrous world in which we live to become a little more complete.",Thinking in Systems: A Primer,Donella H. Meadows,[]
