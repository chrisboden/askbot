"As you get older, if you’re at all self-aware, you learn two important things about yourself: what you like, and what you’re good at. Anyone who gets to spend his day doing both of those things is a lucky man.",That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,Marc Randolph,[]
"Nolan Bushnell, the co-founder of Atari, once said something that has always resonated with me. “Everyone who has taken a shower has had an idea,” he said. “But it’s the people who get out of the shower, towel off, and do something about it that make the difference.",That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,Marc Randolph,[]
"You see, a startup is a lonely place. You are working on something that no one believes in, that you’ve been told time and time again will never work. It’s you against the world. But the reality is that you can’t really do it on your own. You need to enlist help. Bring others around to your way of thinking. Let them share in your enthusiasm.",That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,Marc Randolph,[]

"What do they all say? That will never work. By now, I hope you know what my answer to that line is. Nobody Knows Anything. I only get to write this book once. And I’d feel like I missed an opportunity if I ended this story without giving you some advice. The most powerful step that anyone can take to turn their dreams into reality is a simple one: you just need to start. The only real way to find out if your idea is a good one is to do it. You’ll learn more in one hour of doing something than in a lifetime of thinking about it. So take that step. Build something, make something, test something, sell something. Learn for yourself if your idea is a good one. What happens if your idea doesn’t work? What happens if your test fails, if nobody orders your product or joins your club? What if sales don’t go up and customer complaints don’t go down? What if you get halfway through writing your novel and get writer’s block? What if after dozens of tries – even hundreds of attempts – you still haven’t seen your dream become anything close to real? You have to learn to love the problem, not the solution. That’s how you stay engaged when things take longer than you expected.",That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,Marc Randolph,[]
"Epiphanies are rare. And when they appear in origin stories, they're often oversimplified or just plain false. We like these tales because they align with a romantic idea about inspiration and genius",That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,Marc Randolph,[]

Real innovation comes not from top-down pronouncements and narrowly defined tasks.

We call it being loosely coupled but tightly aligned.,That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,Marc Randolph,[]
"Truths like: Distrust epiphanies. The best ideas rarely come on a mountaintop in a flash of lightning. They don’t even come to you on the side of a mountain, when you’re stuck in traffic behind a sand truck. They make themselves apparent more slowly, gradually, over weeks and months. And in fact, when you finally have one, you might not realize it for a long time.",That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,Marc Randolph,[]
"Epiphanies are rare. And when they appear in origin stories, they’re often oversimplified or just plain false. We like these tales because they align with a romantic idea about inspiration and genius. We want our Isaac Newtons to be sitting under the apple tree when the apple falls. We want Archimedes in his bathtub. But the truth is usually more complicated than that. The truth is that for every good idea, there are a thousand bad ones. And sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference.",That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,Marc Randolph,[]

"Now, of course, Netflix’s culture is famous. There’s a much-downloaded PowerPoint presentation given to all new employees. But the truth is, it wasn’t the product of meetings or careful planning or roundtable discussions. It arose organically, through a shared set of values among a team of people who had been through their fair share of offices—startups, major corporations, and everywhere in between. Netflix, for all of us, was an opportunity to work at the kind of place we’d always dreamed about. It was a chance to do things truly our way. Culture isn’t what you say. It’s what you do.",That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,Marc Randolph,[]

"In the book ‘That Will Never Work’ by Marc Randolph, Reed Hastings gives Marc advice on starting a new company: You need the same people to return and use your product.

There is no way you can succeed if you must keep finding new customers. - Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix",The $20 SaaS Company: from Zero to Seven Figures without Venture Capital,Joseph Anderson,[]
People don’t want hot tubs—not really. They don’t want free snacks or Ping-Pong tables or kombucha on tap. What they really want is freedom and responsibility.

"So we did. There was no vote, no momentous ballot-casting. We printed out that spreadsheet and stared at it. Everyone went home to sleep on it. The next day, we all agreed: we were NetFlix.com.

"It was time to seek strategic alternatives. Sound like jargon? That’s because it is. Silicon Valley is full of nonsense phrases just like it. For instance, when someone says that he’s leaving to spend more time with his family, what that really means is my ass got fired. When someone says this marketing copy just needs some wordsmithing, what they really mean is this sucks and needs to be completely rewritten. When someone says we decided to pivot, what they really mean is we fucked up, royally. And when a company decides to seek strategic alternatives, what they’re saying is: We’ve got to sell this sucker. And fast.",That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,Marc Randolph,[]

"Because if Nobody Knows Anything – if it’s truly impossible to know in advance which ideas are the good ones and which aren’t, if it’s impossible to know who is going to succeed and who isn’t – then any idea could be the one to succeed. If Nobody Knows Anything, then you have to trust yourself. You have to test yourself. And you have to be willing to fail.",That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,Marc Randolph,[]
"Focus. It’s an entrepreneur’s secret weapon. Again and again in the Netflix story—dropping DVD sales, dropping à la carte rentals, and eventually dropping many members of the original Netflix team—we had to be willing to abandon parts of the past in service of the future. Sometimes, focus this intense looks like ruthlessness—and it is, a little bit. But it’s more than that. It’s something akin to courage.",That Will Never Work: The Birth of Netflix and the Amazing Life of an Idea,Marc Randolph,[]
