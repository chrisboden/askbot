"And not just the right thing; it’s profoundly the right thing to do, because the one argument for accessibility that doesn’t get made nearly often enough is how extraordinarily better it makes some people’s lives.

Sometimes time spent reinventing the wheel results in a revolutionary new rolling device. But sometimes it just amounts to time spent reinventing the wheel.,Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability,Steve Krug,"['creativity', 'design', 'invention', 'work']"
"Faced with the prospect of following a convention, there’s a great temptation for designers to try reinventing the wheel instead, largely because they feel (not incorrectly) that they’ve been hired to do something new and different, not the same old thing. Not to mention the fact that praise from peers, awards, and high-profile job offers are rarely based on criteria like “best use of conventions.” Occasionally, time spent reinventing the wheel results in a revolutionary new rolling device. But usually it just amounts to time spent reinventing the wheel.","Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability",Steve Krug,[]

"The more you watch users carefully and listen to them articulate their intentions, motivations, and thought processes, the more you realize that their individual reactions to Web pages are based on so many variables that attempts to describe users in terms of one-dimensional likes and dislikes are futile and counter-productive. Good design, on the other hand, takes this complexity into account.",Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability,Steve Krug,"['design', 'usability', 'user-centered-design', 'user-experience', 'users']"

"Or as Jakob Nielsen so aptly put it: The human brain’s capacity doesn’t change from one year to the next, so the insights from studying human behavior have a very long shelf life.

"In the last few years, making things more usable has become almost everybody’s responsibility. Visual designers and developers now often find themselves doing things like interaction design (deciding what happens next when the user clicks, taps, or swipes) and information architecture (figuring out how everything should be organized).

"The problem is, the rewards and the costs of adding more things to the Home page aren’t shared equally. The section that’s being promoted gets a huge gain in traffic, while the overall loss in effectiveness of the Home page as it gets more cluttered is shared by all sections.","Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability",Steve Krug,[]
The reality is that in the business world almost everyone is just a very small cog in a huge collection of cogs.2 2 Sorry. Try not to take it personally. Do good work. Enjoy your home life. Be happy.,"Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability",Steve Krug,[]

"Demonstrate ROI. In this approach, you gather and analyze data to prove that a usability change you’ve made resulted in cost savings or additional revenue (“Changing the label on this button increased sales by 0.25%”). There’s an excellent book about it: Cost-justifying Usability: An Update for the Internet Age, edited by Randolph Bias and Deborah Mayhew.","Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability",Steve Krug,[]
One way to look at design—any kind of design—is that it’s essentially about constraints (things you have to do and things you can’t do) and tradeoffs (the less-than-ideal choices you make to live within the constraints).,"Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability",Steve Krug,[]
"Having something pinned down can have a focusing effect, where a blank canvas with its unlimited options—while it sounds liberating—can have a paralyzing effect.","Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability",Steve Krug,[]
"What works is good, integrated design that fills a need—carefully thought out, well executed, and tested.","Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability",Steve Krug,[]
"A lot of happy talk is the kind of self-congratulatory promotional writing that you find in badly written brochures. Unlike good promotional copy, it conveys no useful information, and it focuses on saying how great we are, as opposed to explaining what makes us great.","Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability",Steve Krug,[]
"Instead of calls to action, the most innovative user experiences may be calls to inaction. (Design of default options is exceedingly important and superbly discussed in Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein’s excellent Nudge.21) Web usability guru Steve Krug provocatively articulates this design sensibility in his heuristic, “Don’t Make Me Think.” Often the best way to get customers to appreciate an innovation experience is by not making demands on them. Don’t get in the way by offering to help. Engagement sometimes undermines a quality user experience. Eliminating choice frequently proves to be the best possible design choice. Because customers often prefer “mindless choices,” says Krug, minimalism is a virtue.",Who Do You Want Your Customers to Become?,Michael Schrage,[]
"Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Krug is an excellent introduction to web usability. We passionately believe it should be on the school curriculum. Designed for Use by Lukas Mathis is less entertaining than Don’t Make Me Think, but it covers more usability concepts. If this book list seems worryingly short, that’s a testament to how much ground this book covers. The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward R. Tufte contains many examples of complex data shown in beautifully elegant ways. Don’t be put off by its technical-sounding title. It’s fun to read.",Making Websites Win: Apply the Customer-Centric Methodology That Has Doubled the Sales of Many Leading Websites,Karl Blanks,[]
"Designing, building, and maintaining a great Web site or app isn’t easy. It’s like golf: a handful of ways to get the ball in the hole, a million ways not to.","Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability",Steve Krug,[]

"Clear, well-thought-out navigation is one of the best opportunities a site has to create a good impression.","Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability",Steve Krug,[]
"Another needless source of question marks over people’s heads is links and buttons that aren’t obviously clickable.

"I usually call these endless discussions “religious debates,” because they have a lot in common with most discussions of religion and politics: They consist largely of people expressing strongly held personal beliefs about things that can’t be proven—supposedly in the interest of agreeing on the best way to do something important",Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability,Steve Krug,[]

"Too-subtle visual cues are actually a very common problem. Designers love subtle cues, because subtlety is one of the traits of sophisticated design.

"Vigorous writing is concise.

"It’s good to do your testing with participants who are like the people who will use your site, but the truth is that recruiting people who are from your target audience isn’t quite as important as it may seem. For many sites, you can do a lot of your testing with almost anybody. And if you’re just starting to do testing, your site probably has a number of usability flaws that will cause real problems for almost anyone you recruit.","Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability",Steve Krug,[]
