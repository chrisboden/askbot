"# 10 skills I look for before writing a check Part 1


One of the questions I’m most often asked as a VC is what I’m looking for in an investment. For me I’ve stated publicly that 70% of my investment decision is the team and most of this is skewed toward the founders. I’ve watched people who went to the top schools, got the best grades and worked for all the right companies flame out.

So what skills does it take to be a successful entrepreneur? What attributes am I looking for during the process? Having been through the experience as an entrepreneur twice myself, I have developed a list of what I think it takes.

Tenacity is probably the most important attribute in an entrepreneur. It’s the person who never gives up — who never accepts “no” for an answer. The world is filled with doubters who say that things can’t be done and then pronounce after the fact that they “knew it all along.” Look at Google. You think that anybody really believed 1999 that two young kids out of Stanford had a shot at unseating Yahoo!, Excite, Ask Jeeves and Lycos? Yeah, right. Trust me, whatever you want to build you’ll be told by most VC’s something like, “Social networking has already been done,” “You’ll never get a telecom carrier deal done,” or “Google already has a product in this area.” You’ll be told by the people you want to recruit that they’re not sure about joining, by a landlord that you’ll need a year’s deposit or by a potential business development partner that they’re too busy to work with you, “come back in 6 months.”

If you’re already running a startup you know all this. But some founders have that extra quality that makes them never give up. At times it goes as far as being chutzpah. And I see this extra dose of tenacity in only about 1 of 10 entrepreneurs that I see. And if you’re not naturally one of these people you probably know it, too. You see that peer who always pushes things further than you normally would. What are you going to get further out of your comfort zone and be more tenacious? It is really what separates the wheat from the chaff.

I once had a debate with a prominent VC on a panel. The moderator asked the question, “if an entrepreneur writes an email to a VC and doesn’t hear back what should they do?” This VC responded, “Move on. Next on the checklist. He’s not interested.” Without much thought I shot back, “That’s the worst advice I’ve ever heard someone give an entrepreneur.” Doh. I almost couldn’t believe I had blurted it out, but what came out of my mouth was so heartfelt that it just rolled out.

If you fold at the first un-returned email what hope do you have as an entrepreneur? As an entrepreneur, people aren’t going to respond to you and it’s your responsibility to politely and assertively stay on people’s radar screen. You no longer work for Google, Oracle, Salesforce.com or McKinsey where everybody calls you back. You had no idea how important that brand name was until you left it behind. Your customers don’t care that you went to Standford, Harvard or MIT. It’s just you now. And frankly if you went to a state college in Florida you’re at no disadvantage in the tenacity column. Persistence will pay off.

OK, so you’re a tenacious person — you never give up. Well obviously that’s meaningless if your startup idea sucks. I don’t think it takes book smart people to build great companies — sometimes it’s a hindrance. But you do have to be a smart person and I personally prefer street smarts. I’m looking for the person that just “gets it.” They know instinctively how customers buy and how to excite them. They have a sixth sense for the competitors’ weaknesses. They spot opportunities that aren’t being met and the design products to meet these needs.

Because they’re street smart, most great entrepreneurs tend to prefer getting out and talking with real customers rather than sitting in a cubicle all day doing beautiful PowerPoint slides. And when they walk in my office and present you can tell that they know what they’re talking about. You can practically hear the “voice of the customer” when they’re presenting their concept.

I often tell people that I’m looking for people who weren’t born with a silver spoon in their mouths. I like people who aren’t worried about the social consequences of doing something they’re not supposed to. That’s why I personally believe many immigrants or children of immigrants fare well in business. It never occurs to them to play by the same rules as everybody else; in fact, I’m not sure if they even know what the “rules” are. It leads many of these people to be more street smart than those defined by convention.

I don’t like to invest in people that I’ve never met before who come through my office wanting to have a term sheet within 30 days. I don’t think most VC’s do. Yes, there is the mythical company you all heard about that walked into Sequoia and had a term sheet 24 hours later. I’m sure that happens. But in most situations a VC will want to be able to judge how you perform over time. It’s what prompted my post on how to build relationships with VCs.

VCs often tell entrepreneurs that they want to see “traction” before they’re ready to invest. What I believe they really want is longer to get to know you. And part of what they’re looking for is how you adapt to the business you’re building over time. Every entrepreneur starts with an idea that they believe makes sense. But then your customers start using your products, your competitors come out with new offerings and your business partners decide to launch a similar product rather than working with you. You’re forced to “pivot” on a regular basis. The best entrepreneurs get market feedback regularly and change their approach based on the latest information. The best entrepreneurs seek advice from everybody they need, learn lessons and make minor adjustments on a monthly basis.

This is the reason that I’m personally not that anal about your financial model. I’ve stated publicly that you MUST have a financial model because it serves as your ongoing compass and strategy but it will change on a regular basis during your first 2 years. So much so that your financial model 2 years out won’t resemble your starting model at all!

So, for me, seeing how you respond to market challenges, what you learn and how you adapt is one of the most critical pieces of information I can collect about whether or not I want to invest in your company.

I like to say that “being an entrepreneur is really sexy… for those who have never done it.” The reality is that it’s lonely, hard work, high pressure and filled with mundane tasks. It’s a gritty existence. In the grand scheme of things no matter how hard you work and despite your appearance on the TechCrunch50 stage, no one seems to really care. That next round of investment is proving difficult. Customers are harder to sign than you want.  Journalists have just written an article that wasn’t favorable. Your competitors just announced positive news. You’ve got 8 weeks of cash left and one of your employees just asked you to fill out a form so she can buy a house.

Every day you go home and face self-doubt but you’ve got to come back in the morning strong. Your employees are looking in your eyes for signs of weakness and self-doubt. They believe in you and they draw strength from you. You’ve got to be able to come out of unsuccessful VC meetings, pull your socks up, and go into the next pitch. You’ve got to accept customer losses as learning experiences and see how you can improve next time. You’ve got to see your product weaknesses and plug them. You’ve got to hear all of the doubters, and the world is FILLED with doubters, and still not give up. Resilience is one of the tell tale signs of an entrepreneur.

As a VC, if I can tell that you’ve survived tough times and you don’t appear beaten down that’s a huge plus. People always think that the big, successful brands they know were huge success stories from day one. GRP Partners funded Starbucks and Costco. I can tell you both were less than 30 days from bankruptcy early in their lives. They were survivors. One of the most famous case of resiliency in the US history is Abe Lincoln. If you haven’t seen how many setbacks Abe had before becoming president check out the link.

Or, more succinctly, from Sir Winston Churchill, “Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm.” (quote via David Fishman)

As an entrepreneur you’re always under-resourced. You want to hire a crack team of developers but you haven’t raised enough money yet. You want that key marketing resource from Google but he’s on a fat salary that you can’t match. You’re trying to get your contacts to get you that introduction to Ron Conway to sprinkle his legitimacy on your company through an angel investment. All of these things are nearly impossible for most entrepreneurs. And tenacity alone won’t yield positive results.

Often entrepreneurs show me their management team slides with the names of the people who are going to join him once they’re funded. I usually jokingly respond, “maybe you’re not an entrepreneur?” This always gets people to sit up straight 😉 I say, “listen, nearly every successful entrepreneur I’ve ever met has a certain ‘X-Factor’ about them that makes people take notice. I know that these people who you want to join you are in comfortable positions at brand name companies and don’t want to take the risk of joining you. But when the right entrepreneur comes along they think, ‘I’ve got to join this person now. I think this is going to be hugely successful and I don’t want to miss the opportunity.'”

The best entrepreneurs are like that. When you’re around them it’s almost contagious. They are passionate about what they’re doing, they’re confident about their success and they’re driven to make it happen. Sure, they have self doubt when they’re alone looking in the mirror, but you’d never know it from seeing them in the office. And what you need to know is that for every chart you put up with the people who are going to join you when you’re funded, I see companies that have actually gotten the team on board with no more cash in the bank than you have.

Whenever I’m watching someone present to me I’m often thinking to myself, “Can this person inspire others?” And inspiration is so important because not only is it required to hire and lead your team, but it’s required to get customers to work with you when, by all means, they should not. You’ve got less than 6 months cash in the bank and your product isn’t really fully baked. But they have confidence that you’ll get there even if they don’t acknowledge this to themselves. TechCrunch is going to cover you. They probably shouldn’t because you’re a bit more hype than reality right now. But they sense your trajectory. They get a sixth sense that you’re going to pull this thing off. Inspiration goes a long way in business.

"# 10 skills I look for before writing a check Part 2 Perspiration and Appetite for Risk

There are 10 skills I look for in an entrepreneur before writing a check.  They are not things that a VC can pick up on in 3 meetings spread out over 6 weeks, which is why I believe that raising VC is something you do over a long period of time, rather than just 2 months of the year. It’s best to meet VCs when you don’t need their money, so they can really get to know you.

In Part 1, I published the first five skills I look for in an entrepreneurs: tenacity, street smarts, resiliency, ability to pivot, and inspiration.  I then elaborated on each of the topics in my blog series on VC startup advice.

Through comment conversations with many of you I tried to emphasize that it isn’t enough to just have one attribute.  Being tenacious without the mental flexibility to pivot based on market feedback is a disaster.  Having street smarts with no inspirational ability to build teams can yield a great small business but will be difficult to scale into a large VC-backed business.

So we as VCs search for entrepreneurs/founders who have the whole package or as much of it as possible.  Few people have it.

These are often amazingly talented people who are really strong in some of the skill areas and there is no shame in this. They often make great team members such as head of products, CTO, head of sales, CFO, etc. Great companies are comprised of great individual point people or functional leaders.

But when I’m looking to write my check I need to look in the eyes of the captain — the maestro who brings the whole orchestra together. And this is where the last post left off — inspiration.

Inspiration alone is not enough.  We’ve all met inspirational leaders who talk the great talk.  They get you all jazzed up after a company meeting but fail to get people to take action or to get things done themselves.  Inspiration without perspiration is the equivalent of being a coach — not a CEO.  Inspiration is part of what a VC provides, including goal setting, cheerleading, and challenging you.  But the CEO needs to move the ball forward a few inches every day. Your VC can’t do that for you.

Celebrity CEOs

As a VC, I also see the apparently great leader who is a great public speaker and networker.  He does the conference circuit but is somehow missing from running his company. Someone  else is left back at the ranch minding the shop.  Worse yet, internal company decisions often aren’t made without the CEO around and in-fighting amongst the direct reports is not uncommon.  Talk to any management team with a “celebrity seeking” CEO and you’ll see what I mean.

If you’re the guy at every conference don’t think that people don’t notice.  I notice.  I love hanging out with you.  I’ll gladly drink a few beers with you.  But when it comes time to cut checks I’m backing the guy who’s back at the office getting stuff done. I believe great leaders eschew the limelight in favor of building their companies. (before I get attacked in the comments section I’m not saying ZERO conferences — but you need to be selective.)

I would also say that I found some VCs can’t tell the difference because they haven’t been inside an early-stage company so these CEO’s are usually able to raise money.  VC money does not equal success.

99% perspiration

The most poignant quote about perspiration comes from Thomas Edison, “Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.” For entrepreneurs it’s probably a healthy dose of both.  I know you think a VC would take for granted that all entrepreneurs work hard but you can tell the difference between those that see their startup as merely a slightly longer version of their last big job and those that are maniacal and focused about what they’re doing.

My favorite example is Jason Nazar, the CEO of DocStoc.  There’s no ‘off button’ on this guy.  He’s always open for business.  If I’m up super late trying to crank out work, I often get IM messages from Jason at 1am.  He attends many social events in the LA scene but he seems to always go back to the office afterward.  He’s at TechCrunch50 but he knows why he’s there, who he wants to meet, and what he wants out of those meetings.  It’s not a boondoggle.  It’s all part of his DocStoc obsession.

Starting a company isn’t a job

There was a recent TechCrunch UK article  by an anonymous VC (yes, I think posting anonymously is chicken shit) that talked about the work ethic of European tech companies versus those Silicon Valley.  I retweeted this article and got some people in Europe telling me it was unfair to stereotype this way.  It’s not.  The reality is that many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs/companies are more obsessive and maniacal about their businesses in a way that many others around the world are not.  The local culture breeds it.  I’m not saying it’s good or bad — it just IS.  Europe isn’t the only place to garner criticism for not being driven enough.  We get the same criticism in Los Angeles.

But that  doesn’t have to be you.  If you want a “job”, don’t be an entrepreneur.  It’s not a job — it’s your life. I recently posted some VC startup advice about the need for entrepreneurs to have a bias toward action or JFDI (a play on the Nike slogan).  Well the second sign I had on the wall of my first startup was SITE.  Ask anybody who worked with me how seriously I took it.  Sleep is the Enemy.

Success breeds competition — from around the world

For every person who comes into my office with a good idea I respond, “Don’t worry about your failure, worry about your success.  If you fail, you move on.  But if your good idea pops big time then, trust me, there will be three Ph.D.’s from Stanford sharing a cheap apartment in San Jose working around the clock to beat you.  They’ll be eating Ramen or Taco Bell every night and saving their pennies to pour into the company.”

It may be unfair, but it’s the reality of capitalism.  It’s the dynamic that drives innovation.  In the future, the competition won’t only be in San Jose, but also in Shanghai, Seoul, and Bangalore. I only wish more people in the US Congress understood this as well as Brad Feld does.  The Startup Visa is one of our most important innovation movements.  You think China can’t build great Internet companies?  Have you heard of TenCent?  It’s more valuable than Facebook.

In conclusion, if you’re not prepared to be “all in”, then you’re not prepared to build a huge company.  You think Marc Benioff built Salesforce.com into a multi-billion company by having a good idea?  I can tell you from having been on the inside that even now this guy never shuts off.  He’s driven.  He creates the success at Salesforce.com.  He’s a billionaire and he still works harder than many startups.  Are you willing to go that hard for that long?

Entrepreneurs are risk takers.  Not wild speculators, but pragmatic risk takers who have a blind belief that they will find a way to make things work.  If you put on paper what it would take to be successful in your company, you’d never take the first step, which is why most people don’t.  It is often called a “leap of faith” because you jump from safety into the abyss with only the blind faith that you’ll find a way.

If you won’t take the risk, why should I?

I know it sounds trite to say that entrepreneurs are risk takers so let me describe the normal, rational person who I meet on a regular basis.  I was recently on TWiST with Jason Calacanis.  A caller dialed in to ask us questions about his startup.  He was from South America but living in Switzerland and had launched a startup while holding down a day job at a consulting firm (McKinsey if memory serves).  He wanted to raise angel money.  I told him to quit his job first.  If he wasn’t prepared to do that he wasn’t a real entrepreneur.

I know that 80+% of the people listening to me must have thought that was the wrong advice.  But to me if you’re not willing to quit and take a risk on yourself, then you’re not confident enough in your own idea and skills.  Why should I be? If you’re idea is so amazing that it warrants my hard-earned angel money then why should I take a risk on you if you won’t take a risk on yourself?

The locked-up entrepreneur who wouldn’t jump

About a year ago I had lunch with a guy who I believe is an amazing entrepreneur.  He had built and sold his first company and had good ideas for his second company.  He gave me the 50,000 foot idea and he was convinced that this idea would be a monster.  The problem was that he was still working out the lock-up period in his big company.

He and his partner told me about this new idea over the course of nearly a year.  I finally called bullshit. If this idea was so big then why would they risk not being first to market, not building defensible IP for the sake of a few hundred thousand dollars extra in lock-up money at a big company? I think the mind of an entrepreneur would be far more paranoid about yielding his great next idea than protecting his last 20% payout on the last one.  They finally quit.  I’m enjoying watching their progress.

The MBA who wouldn’t jump

I run recruiting for my VC firm, GRP Partners.  About 18 months ago in early 2008 we hired an analyst (pre-MBA), but wanted to wait until after Summer to hire a post-MBA associate.  It was May.  I received an unsolicited resume from a second-year MBA student at Stanford.  He had exactly the skills I was looking for in an associate.  I interviewed him on the phone and in person.  I introduced him to my partners who liked him.  But we weren’t ready to hire an associate yet so I offered him a summer internship.  He told me that, as a second-year student, he could only accept a summer internship if I would guarantee him the job in the fall if he performed well.  He wanted an assurance that if he performed well, we wouldn’t go through a recruiting process.

I told him I couldn’t guarantee that.  If he was confident in his skills he should take the internship.  I told him I couldn’t imagine that a guy performing really well on the inside had anything to worry about from a great resume and interview from somebody we didn’t really know.  I told him to join and “become part of the furniture.”  Without the guarantee, he turned me down.  A few months later he called me back and said he would take the internship.  I told him, “Sorry mate, it was a one-time offer.  You had the door cracked open and should have taken it.”

Was I too harsh?  I don’t think so.  I want our associate to have empathy for the customers we serve — our portfolio companies. If the person I hired wasn’t cut from the same cloth as an entrepreneur, then how could I expect him to be able to see inside the mind of entrepreneurs?

My leap into venture capital

I joined GRP Partners in 2007 before they raised their current fund (we closed a $200 million fund in March 2009).  They told me not to join until after the fund-raising was done.  I told them it was now or never.  “Once you’re done raising a fund you’ll hire anybody you want!  I want to join now while there’s risk. I’ll help you raise the fund.  And I’ll take the risk. Pay me half salary until the fund is closed. I’ll pay my own moving costs and if we don’t raise the fund you owe me nothing.”

I figured that the alternative was that I start my third company with no salary and all risk.  I had nothing to lose!  And so it was.  If I was willing to take risks to get into VC then how could I accept an associate who had no cojones?  And how can I fund you if you don’t?

"# 10 skills I look for before writing a check Part 3 Detail Orientation Competitiveness Decisiveness

This is the last in a three-part series about the 10 things I look for in an entrepreneur. In Part 1, I addressed tenacity, street smarts, resiliency, ability to pivot, and inspiration. In Part 2, I discussed perspiration and appetite for risk. I elaborated on each of the topics in my blog series on VC startup advice.

Most successful entrepreneurs have an attractive mix of skills, know-how and personal qualities that separate them from the herd. Today I cover three more of these critical elements and throw in a couple of bonus entries that didn’t make my top 10 list but are important nonetheless.

One of the easiest ways to rule out an entrepreneur is when he doesn’t know the details of his business. There are tell-tale signs, and discussions about competitors often expose them. You can tell whether an entrepreneur has logged into his competitors’ products, talked to their customers, read news coverage of them and gotten the back-channel info.

You can tell if the entrepreneur has a deep-seated competitive spirit. Can’t go a mile deep on competition? Buh-bye.

Let’s talk about your product, and let’s look at your financial projections. Can’t walk me through them on a granular basis? Did someone else pull your financial model together while you did “your job”? Not good enough. The best entrepreneurs focus on details. They can tell you the square-foot costs of their property, how much they spend monthly on Amazon Web Services, and the 12 features being developed for the next release.

Another big tell is a CEO’s grasp of the sales pipeline. I can’t tell you how many CEOs I’ve met who can’t walk me through the details of their sales pipeline. I want the names of key buyers, when you met them last, who the competition is, and what the criteria is for making a decision. You think we’re just going to talk about your largest lead? Sorry. Let’s go through the whole pipeline, please. I care about the details, but I’m more interested in finding out whether you do.

Along with detail orientation, I have a strong bias for “doers”. When I ask for a quick demo and the CEO suggests a follow-up meeting with a sales rep because he’s not “a demo guy,” I usually think to myself, “A follow-up meeting probably isn’t necessary.” Similarly, if you need your CFO to walk me through your financial model, you’re probably not the right investment for me.

Ask any CFO I worked with as a CEO: They did the hard work, but I edited the spreadsheets cell by cell. In fact, I usually built the first three versions of the financial model (but then my ADD took over, and I needed a great closer to make the model complete). Founders need to be hands-on. As I wrote in an earlier blog post: “You can’t run a burger chain if you’ve never flipped burgers.”

A startup seeking investment from me once put their “president” on a call with me. When I told him that “president” was a strange title for a startup, he announced they also a CEO. When asked about their different roles, the president told me the CEO set the strategy while he traveled to conferences evangalizing on behalf of the company. “So who runs the company on a daily basis?” I asked. “Oh,” he responded, “we have a COO.” The company had under $1 million in revenue and was burning $850k a month. It had a strategy-setting CEO, a limelight-seeking President and a COO who ran the company.

I gave that company one of the cheekiest responses I have given in my two and a half years as a VC: “You don’t want to raise money from me,” I said. “The first thing I would do is fire you. Then I’d fire the CEO. Then I’d cut the burn to a realistic level and build a company.” They got their round done anyway from a big late-stage VC. One of the large parts of the burn was PR, marketing, and conference attendance. There are VCs who are fooled by all of this, but it doesn’t equal success. A year later the president and the CEO had moved on.

Bad VCs funded this madness in the first place and weren’t close enough to the company to see what was happening. When the CEO of an early-stage startup tells me he plans to hire a COO, I’m usually not interested in another meeting. (Funny side-note: The company was recently nominated for a Crunchie Award. Unfortunately, money can buy you awards.)

As I wrote in my previous post on perspiration, good ideas attract competition.

Everybody these days is fascinated by the “private sale” concept offered by companies like Gilt, Ruelala and HauteLook. There are some great companies in this category, but the initial category killer was a French company called Vente Privee (which translates to “private sale”). From what I’m told, the founders were in the Schmatta (Jobber) business selling other people’s excess, end-of-line inventory at a bargain. There wasn’t the same end-of life infrastructure that we have in the U.S. (think T.J. Maxx), so they had an early lead. When the internet part of their business took off, a number of competitors surfaced.

By then, Vente Privee was a powerhouse and they used that market power. They made it clear to suppliers that Vente Privee would stop carrying their products if they supplied the newly formed competitors. This was a bare-knuckle industry, and money was at stake. Good competitors fight.

Just ask Overture about Google (“Don’t be evil”) and how they competed in international markets. It wasn’t all smiles, hugs and “let the best man win.” A lot was at stake, and Google competed fiercely.

Have a nice little idea and think you can carve out a large market niche? Not if you’re a nice guy. I’m not saying you need to be an arsehole, but entrepreneurs hate to lose. They’re hyper-competitive in everything they do. I look for that fighting spirit in the individuals at my table. It doesn’t matter if they’re playing golf, poker, Ping-Pong, Scrabble, or Guitar Hero. Entrepreneurs play to win, and they take losing seriously.

Think Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t have some sleepless nights about Twitter despite having more than 300 million users himself? Steve Jobs isn’t a “nice guy.” Nor are Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, Marc Benioff, Larry Ellison, Tom Siebel, Rupert Murdoch, or any number of people you’ll find who built empires.

Being an entrepreneur is about moving the ball forward a few inches every day. What astounded me when I switched from being a big-company executive to an entrepreneur was the sheer number of decisions I had to make on a daily basis.

They sound so basic when you’re not the one having to make them. Should you go with Amazon Web Services (AWS) or have your own servers hosted at RackSpace? Should you build in Ruby, Java, or .NET? Should you sign a two-year lease or rent month-to-month? Should you hire an extra developer now or a business development resource? Should you take angel money or just go for a seed round from a VC? Is venture debt a good idea? Should we launch at TechCrunch50? Should we charge for a product or offer freemium? Should we ask for a credit card up front, even if we don’t charge for 30 days?

It never ends. There is no such thing as a startup decision with complete information. The best entrepreneurs have a bias for making quick decisions and accept that, at best, 70 percent of them will be right. They acknowledge some decisions will be bad and they’ll have to recover from them. Building a startup might be a game of inches, but you don’t get timeouts to pause and analyze all of your decisions.

I recently have been considering investing in an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley. He was deciding between taking another senior role at a prominent Silicon Valley tech company and starting his own business. I told him I didn’t think he needed any more resume-stuffers and now was the time to go do something big on his own. Within a week he delivered a deck outlining his strategy for a new company. A day after we discussed the possibility of him flying down to meet with my partners, he was on a plane.

He then booked tickets to China to talk with suppliers and promised to revise his strategy by the time he returned to the U.S. He is getting stuff done in entrepreneur years, which is a step change faster than dog years. By the time we speak again, I’ll be able to judge results by the quality of his thinking about the opportunity. But by that time, I imagine, he will have made so much progress that he’ll question whether he should take my money. I’m certain he will have talked with other funding sources. This is how it should be.

If you’ve been “thinking about doing something” and batting the idea around with your favorite VC more than six months, don’t be surprised if they’re not prepared to back you in the end. Entrepreneurs don’t “noodle”. They “do”.

Now that I’ve addressed the top 10 skills I look for in an entrepreneur before investing in them, I’d like to offer two additional qualities that can be critically important but won’t necessarily hold someone back from seeing success.

This isn’t a “must” for me, but it’s certainly a huge plus when entrepreneurs have it. You can spend a year putting your hypotheses on paper while researching a market. But you never really have a handle in the minute details of the industry until you’ve lived in it. If you are launching mobile application and have sector experience working for Apple, Blackberry, AdMob, or JAMDDAT, then I know your product will have your experiences baked into it.

I learned this lesson when I launched my first company in 1999. We offered a SaaS document management in the cloud (we were called ASPs back then). I had no experience in document management systems beyond being a user, and nobody had SaaS experience because the market was too new. We were forced to make assertions about features we thought people would want, how to price them, and how to overcome objections to managing data in the cloud.

When I began hiring product managers, sales reps, and implementation staff, I benefited from what employees learned working at places like Documentum and OpenText. They brought the lessons they had learned in their companies over the previous decade. I know this stuff cold now. So when I launched my second company – which was also a SaaS Document Management company – we already had a vision for what would do well in the marketplace.

Domain experience also brings relationships. If you spent three years building relationships with senior executives at media companies, a starting point for your next business ought to be, “How can I exploit these relationships in the next venture I launch?”

One successful entrepreneur I know wanted to launch his next venture in financial services because it was a bigger industry. Fine. But I pointed out that he would be up against competitors who had spent years building relationships with the big financial services companies (as well as channel partners), and he would be starting from scratch. I’m not sure why you’d do that unless you had to.

The most obvious attribute that didn’t make my top 10 list is integrity. It is very important to me. If I thought I could make a lot of money backing a dishonest person, I personally would pass. I know many private equity firms that would not. I’m proud that most early-stage VCs I know care about making money ethically. So you should include integrity on my personal list of attributes required to raise money from a reputable, early-stage VC.

Unfortunately, people with low integrity can be successful and can raise money from investors. So I left it off the master list. I personally know a billionaire CEO who I wouldn’t put high on the list of people with high integrity. But he built his company from scratch to become a very large enterprise.  He is well respected (but not liked) in his industry and in his company.  He spends a lot of money on personal marketing so the story is written the way he wants it.

But I’ve seen his actions up-close and wouldn’t claim that they are high on the integrity scale.  I’ve heard this about similar technology executives of some of the biggest names in history.

I also know him to not be a very happy man.  Money can buy a lot of things but, as the saying goes, it can’t, in and of itself, buy you happiness.  I believe that true happiness comes from a sense of fulfillment, giving, and doing what your moral compass knows is right.  Better that you be this person, whatever level of business success you achieve in life.

"# 6year vesting

Every team member of AngelList is on a 6-year vesting schedule. Including the founders. Why?

Because it takes a long time to build something important. And we want everyone to stick around for a long time. 

Because we want people who are here for the mission, not a payday.

Because it sells prospective hires: the team you’re joining isn’t going anywhere. 

Does that mean I get more equity?

Everyone asks whether they get more equity to make up for the longer vesting schedule. A good way to think about that is whether we would give smaller grants if new team members were on a 4-year schedule. And the answer to that is ‘yes’. 

There are a lot of benefits to getting additional equity now, instead of 4 years from now:

If you’re interested in a 6-year vesting schedule, AngelList is hiring engineers and designers.

"# A bit of Decisionmaking for startups



“Decisions tend to be judged solely on the results they produce. But I believe the right test should focus heavily on the quality of the decision-making itself…

“Individual decisions can be badly thought through, and yet be successful, or exceedingly well thought through, but be unsuccessful, because the recognized possibility of failure in fact occurs. But over time, more thoughtful decision-making will lead to better overall results, and more thoughtful decision-making can be encouraged by evaluating decisions on how well they were made rather than on outcome…

“It’s not that results don’t matter. They do. But judging solely on results is a serious deterrent to taking the risks that may be necessary to making the right decision. Simply put, the way decisions are evaluated affects the way decisions are made.”

– Robert Rubin
From NYU and  Harvard  commencements

Rubin looks at the world through the lens of probabilities. A good decision might have bad results. But if you have the chance to do it all over again, under the same conditions, you should make the same decision.

“Any time you make a bet with the  best of it, where the odds are in your favor, you have earned something on that bet, whether you actually win or lose the bet. By the same token, when you make a bet with the  worst of it, where the odds are not in your favor, you have lost something, whether you actually win or lose the bet.”

– David Sklansky, The Theory of Poker

Evaluate advisors on the quality of their decision-making, not on the quality of their past outcomes. The same goes for advice from investors, or anyone at all.

Entrepreneurs and investors can make poor decisions and still succeed. They can get lucky. But the odds that the same thinking will work at your company aren’t favorable.

Other startups can make great decisions and still fail. They can get unlucky. But their thinking wasn’t bad — they just need to roll the dice again.

“Simply put, the way decisions are evaluated affects the way decisions are made.”

– Robert Rubin, Ibid.

This is the coolest part of Rubin’s speech.

First, we evaluate decision-making processes and pick one. Second, we execute the process and get a decision. Third, the decision leads to action, which leads to an outcome. (All of these steps can be iterative.)

Does anyone actually evaluate decision-making? Yes. Often it’s implicit. For example, a job interview is an evaluation. A candidate has a decision-making process whether he knows it or not. And an interview evaluates a candidate’s decision-making process whether a startup knows it or not.

The decision-making process you pick is more important than the decisions it produces. And the way you evaluate processes is more important than the process you pick. Evaluation is king.

Evaluate decision-making processes based on their quality, not on a handful of their outcomes. For example, consider whether job interviews are an effective way to evaluate a candidate’s decision-making. In other words, (evaluate (processes for evaluating (processes for making decisions))). In other words, duh.

"# A brief history of your investors and their investors

Why should you read this post? So you know what questions to ask your potential investors about their investors (their limited partners). You need to understand how your investors are compensated, how they’re motivated, and how they’ll act in critical situations — so you know if you and your investor’s commitments are well aligned.

By the end of this two-part post I’ll provide a list of questions to ask investors to help determine if they’re the right investors for you. This post focuses on the history of venture capital. The second post will focus on the present and future of venture capital and how it will affect startups.

Some say that startups should raise smart money but not dumb money. Others say all the money is green, so there’s no difference. The issue is more complex than that. And this complexity involves the capital sources that your investors use as well as the terms of their agreements with limited partners (LPs).

Venture capital firms have limited partners. These limited partners come in all shapes and sizes from all over the world. And in turn these limited partners are frequently entities that are funnels for other sources of money.

Traditionally, angel investors were individuals that would use their own personal capital to make an investment. Recently, “seed stage” venture firms have emerged that have between one to three partners. These seed stage firms are usually backed by institutional limited partners or even by venture firms. They are really small venture firms that present more like angels because there are usually one or two partners running the seed stage firm.

To understand how these angel and VCs roles came to be, we need to look back in history.

Let’s go all the way back to the 1960’s and 1970’s — early days in technology angel and venture investing. There were very few venture firms at the time. Most of them were formed by former technology executives who had had enough of operating but wanted to stay involved in startups. So they took some of the cash they made during their operating careers and started investing in companies that were in their work or social domain. And soon, corporate financial services and university endowments realized that these former execs-turned-angel investors had good instincts about which companies to invest in.

Meanwhile, these corporate financial services and university endowments started to apply financial asset allocation theories to their portfolio. It’s well known in financial theory that the allocation of capital in a fund across asset classes is the single most important decision that affects the fund’s return and volatility. In addition to having investments in liquid public equities, they also had investments in oil & gas funds, real estate, commodities, and other asset classes. These endowments (the early limited partners) started looking for “alpha” so they could outperform other limited-partner managers. So they created a new asset class with the highly descriptive name of “Alternative Assets.”

The LPs saw that angel investors and early venture firms made some spectacular returns. For example, MCI and Amgen came out of early small funds like Charles River Ventures and Genentech came out of  Kleiner Perkins. So the LPs got smart and said, “Aha, let’s allocate some of our alternative investments to venture capital.” In a way, it became the asset they could invest in to differentiate their performance from their competition. And to also earn a healthy bonus for themselves for “winning.”

These financial services companies and endowments would back these angel investors in a firm structure that usually took the form of a limited partnership — which, not incidentally, is totally different than an operating company. A limited partnership has limited partners and general partners; the limited partners are the major sources of capital. Historically, the limited partners would get 80% of the fund’s returns and the general partners would get 20%. The funds were small — for example, Charles River Ventures was $5M in 1970 and Kleiner Perkins was $7M. Most of the capital came from the limited partners.

General partners would typically get a 2% annual management fee. At that time, venture firms had small headcounts and the 2% fee on the small fund was used to cover business expenses like rent, travel, administrative staff, and meals. The fees were not a way to earn a living. And through the 1970’s, venture capital marginally outperformed the horrific public market.

In the early 1980s, the 15-year public equity disaster came to an end. The public market literally went sideways from 1966 to 1981. If you invested $1 in the public stock market in 1966, you would have $1 in 1981. Worse, if you accounted for inflation, you only had 70 cents!

Because of the weak public market, startup valuations were low and investment syndicates were a must. Founders looked for deep pockets, not just easy pockets. In short, money was tight, not a commodity.

Investors were concerned that there would be few exits and worried that, even if companies became cash flow-generating businesses, they wouldn’t necessarily become high margin, high value companies. A whole host of terms became important in the term sheet like redemption rights, dividends, and participating preferred.

Starting in 1982, interest rates fell from 15%+ to 5%, paving the way for a lot of available capital as well as a lot of profit generation. These profits fed back to limited partners, who, in turn, pumped the profits back into venture capital through their “alternative assets” allocation, which was now 5% of their manageable funds. So the terms of limited partner’s investments in venture firms loosened up a bit, which also permitted venture firms to loosen up the terms of their investments into startups.

At the same time, technology companies like Apple and Microsoft were printing money. It was in the air that technology companies would disrupt and create new industries. And our government was printing actual paper money and creating a lot of debt to fund the deficits spurred by high defense spending and other spending. So there was a lot of new liquid capital.

All this extra capital boosted the size of venture funds. There were serious and large limited partners that wanted to place a lot of capital into these well-performing venture funds. These limited partners were university endowments, insurance companies, charitable foundations, as well as  “fund-of-funds,” which were channels that would pool the capital of small limited partners that didn’t have the capital base or reach to invest in these venture firms.

Meanwhile, the 1980s and 1990s marched on, with the public market taking off and seeing an annualized 18% return into 2000. Limited partners were also happy because they were getting good returns, and venture firms were growing and specializing by domain. By 1996, venture firms had total capital of $12B+ and the average venture fund was about $120M.

In the next four years, the public market went ballistic and became a huge bubble. This was partly a social phenomenon, but it was also because of the Fed, which provided easy money at low interest rates. Also, the Fed, fearing a market collapse caused by Y2K problems, was pumping the market with liquidity in 1999.

Valuations on the private market skyrocketed across all stages and private companies were raising capital at billion dollar valuations fairly early in their development. The time frame also accelerated: investments were made within days to weeks and diligence was measured in days.

By 2000, limited partner’s returns were turbocharged and top venture firms saw annualized returns of more than 200% — far in excess of the public market. In fact, from 1995 to 2000, a total of $180B was invested into venture capital and approximately $325B was returned to limited partners. And what did the limited partners do? They put in more money. In fact, they invested $120B into venture capital firms in 2000, a tenfold increase in five years.

Limited partners were very happy with their returns from venture firms and did whatever it took to place their capital into these firms. It was like a feeding frenzy to raise a fund. My partners and I raised a $300M fund in three weeks during that period. It was just really easy. Limited partner allowed select venture firms like CRV to have better carry (25%-30%) and terms between entrepreneurs and VCs loosened up again.

So far so good — until we hit the year 2000, when the public market cratered and limited partners and the broad populace scrambled to defend their portfolios. Cash liquidity decreased and limited partners got very concerned about how some venture firms were being run. They also began to worry about the ballooned size of most venture funds.

But that worry didn’t last long enough, as the Fed began pumping more money into the system to “save” the United States from a recession. The great housing bubble started to grow and the public market began a strong rise in 2003, a rise that buoyed the public market portion of the limiter partners’ funds. LPs began to feel and think more positively, resulting in more capital flowing back to venture capital with good terms intact. Limited partners also began to characterize the bubble as the result of macro forces that were then tamed by Alan Greenspan. As a result, the limited partners rationalized away their worry about venture firms and we soon found ourselves returning to $30B/year going into venture capital each year. This was more sane, but not totally sane.

As the public markets improved, limited partners (who are now both domestic and international capital sources) worried that too much of their portfolio was in the public market and started pumping more money into venture capital firms. From 2002 to 2009, a total of $205B was invested into venture capital, and approximately $220B was returned. You can do the math. That is not a good return for the whole asset class.

What happened? A big part of the problem was that the public market never really responded like it did in the 1990s. The stock market blowout left collective scars across retail and institutional public market investors. There was no crazy bubble period, which was a problem because the amount of venture capital in total was still way too high given the total return. And while venture capital returns did slightly outperform that public market over the decade ending in 2009, the public market returns and private venture capital returns diverged in terms of the median return per company.

Along the way, something interesting happened to the shape of the return curve. In the 1980s and 1990s, venture capital returns were usually Gaussian with respect to their portfolios. Yes, there was Benchmark’s investment in eBay and a couple of others that created 1000x returns. But most of the exits were shaped around $300M exits. A big exit was a 10x return.

In the 2000s, the middle of that curve got blown out, making a lot of portfolios look bipolar. Most portfolio companies returned less than the capital that was put in. And a few companies generated astronomical results: Google measured in the 1,000X to 10,000X multiple. Limited partner data showed that eight venture funded companies a year were generating the vast majority of venture firm profits, and that’s out of a universe of three to four thousand companies funded every year.

Pretty soon this was common knowledge across the limited partner community, and the top limited partners — in terms of size and longevity — were looking for these “return the fund” opportunities when venture firms talked about their investments with them. If you couldn’t speak about a potential “billion dollar opportunity,” limited partners thought you really weren’t in the game. This data started a conversation across the limited partner community, which usually included the words “the fund I invest in better be investing in the next Google.” And limited partners liked to bring that up in their conversation with venture firm’s partners, “Which one of these companies can return the whole fund?”

Additionally, a decade had passed since the 2000 blowout. The decade returns for venture capital in aggregate were weak and limited partners started to reassess how, who, and what venture firms to invest in. And then the savage bear market that started in late 2007 started to ravage the limited partners’ portfolios again. This was the start of limited partners asking tough questions and looking for proof of how returns would get generated over the next decade.

Limited partners face the issue of diminishing returns because they also have shareholders. Likewise, the venture firms and seed stage firms that are down the pipeline from these limited partners are also subject to these hard questions.

Today, we’re beginning to see a shift of money turning back into a commodity. But without the massive government bailouts, it turns out that money supplies like M2 are declining, indicating that the core economic environment is one of deflation. This means that cash is gathering more value than any asset, and this macro shift will shift the balance of valuation and terms in favor of the root sources of capital.

In the next post, I will review what this means for direct investors and what it means for portfolio companies. I’ll also include a list of questions to ask your potential investors to ensure that they’re the right investors for your company.

"# A conflict of interests

If you’re a passionate entrepreneur, you can often see the vast potential for your product. In your head, the possibilities of the future branch out, with infinite forks and potential. When pitching to investors, you’ve learned to define your market as broadly as possible while remaining credible. So, it’s not surprising that you’re disappointed when investors don’t disclose a conflict, and you steer clear of investors who might already have an investment in the same space — dating, social gaming, compliance, security, etc.

If you’re an experienced investor, you’ve seen it all. How every startup thinks they can take over the world, but usually has to struggle to accomplish even its one core product or task. How three copycat business plans will arrive in the same week, and how each one thinks they’re unique and protectable. How domain knowledge and therefore your ability to help a startup accrue by having multiple investments in the same space.

Both points of view are pretty extreme, and the truths about conflicts of interest are highly contextual. Here’s how to think about it.

Firstly, the idea — it’s no big deal. If it’s any good, someone has had it before and someone will have it again. If you’re still convinced it’s that good, go file a patent first, and then go talk about it. Keep in mind that investors outside of big tech (cleantech, biotech…) automatically have a bias against “patented” ideas, and most brilliance seems obvious in hindsight. Ask an investor to sign an NDA, and you’ve just filtered out all but the most desperate investors.

Secondly, the space — it’s tricky, but you have to define it as realistically narrow. There was a time when having an investment in “web” might have been considered a conflict for another “web” company. There was a time when the term “portal” was a competitive category. Unless it’s head-on competition, Foursquare v. Gowalla, Disqus v. IntenseDebate, Google v. Bing, it’s really, honestly, not competitive. If there’s room for multiple equal-sized players in the space, it’s not as competitive as you might think. Also, theories about where you might zig or zag don’t count — just compare on what you’re doing at this moment.

Thirdly, the type of investor matters — active angels have a lot more deals than active VCs and are more likely to have an investment in an adjacent space. This is not a big problem — angels invest in syndicates and usually only provide help in a contextual, on-demand way. Because VCs are likely to be on your board, have more money into the company, and have more control and information rights, it makes more sense to pay attention to conflicts VCs might have (Disclosure: I consider myself to be an angel investor).

Fourthly, just ask the VC to disclose potential conflicts up front, but don’t be too broad-minded about what constitutes a conflict.

Lastly, beware the “entrepreneur check.” This is where the VC tells you that they like your company, want to do due-diligence, and then just have to check with the entrepreneur in one of their investments about whether this investment would be competitive or not. Since entrepreneurs tend to have an overly-broad view of what’s competitive, this check usually fails. Even in the rare case that it doesn’t, it’s used as an excuse by the investor to pass. Therefore, always insist that they run the “entrepreneur check” early in the process, before you’ve invested too much into this investor.

Our flawed patent system aside, ideas do not have the merit that we were all raised believing. You do have to pick the right space, but after that, execution is everything. Here’s a quick confirmation test — go back to your classmates and pick out the smartest ones, and then the hardest working ones. Now look at who is successful. A certain base level of intellect and idea-formation capability is required, but beyond that are strongly diminishing or even negative returns.

Consequently, the best entrepreneurs display a lot of chutzpah. They aren’t fazed by the competition, nor do they see shadows in every corner. They are their own biggest competition.

"# A players write the playbook

Eric Paley’s Curve of Talent is a brutal must-read. I’ve remixed it a bit to come up with the following definitions; the word’s are Eric’s, I’ve just re-ordered them:

F performers are not at all productive.

C performers struggle to competently fill their role, but are somewhat productive with sufficient coaching. Hard to admit, but most people in the business world don’t have a particularly clear idea on how to do their job well. Startups need to help C players transition out of the organization.

B players understand their objectives well and deliver them competently with minimum coaching. Coach B players on the need to not just competently deliver their function, but drive toward innovation within that function.

A players write the book and not just read it. They not only have a clear idea how to competently accomplish their functional objectives, but actually lead the organization to innovate and be world class within their functional area.  They raise the bar on the entire organization. One way these candidates can be identified during an interview is when they actually teach the interviewer something about how the company can win.

"# Accelerate your vesting upon a sale

“We talked to a lot of different angel investors and venture capitalists, but no one really ‘got’ what we were doing — that is until we met Google.”

– Dennis Crowley, Founder of Dodgeball, May 2005

“It’s no real secret that Google wasn’t supporting dodgeball the way we expected. The whole experience was incredibly frustrating for us — especially as we couldn’t convince them that dodgeball was worth engineering resources, leaving us to watch as other startups got to innovate in the mobile + social space… It was a tough decision to walk away…”

– Dennis Crowley, Founder of Dodgeball, April 2007

Summary: Negotiate some acceleration if you sell the company ahead of schedule — you don’t want to stay at the acquirer for an unreasonable period of time. Also negotiate 100% acceleration if the acquirer terminates you and deprives you of the ability to vest your stock.

Your vesting should accelerate upon a change in control of the company, such as a sale of the business.

Your options for acceleration upon a change in control, from best to worst, include



The most common acceleration agreement these days combines 25% – 50% single trigger acceleration with 50% – 100% double trigger acceleration. The median of this range is probably 50% single trigger combined with 100% double trigger.

You can justify single trigger acceleration by arguing that,


“We didn’t start this company so we could work at BigCo X for two or three years. We’re entrepreneurs, not employees. We’re willing to work at BigCo, but not for that long.

If we sell the company after two years, that just means we did what we were supposed to do, but we did it faster than we were supposed to. The investors will be rewarded for an early sale by receiving their profits earlier than they expected. We shouldn’t be penalized for an early sale by having to work at BigCo for years to earn our unvested shares.

Single trigger acceleration reduces the effective time we have to work at BigCo and rewards us for creating profit for the investors ahead of schedule.”

You can justify 100% double trigger acceleration by arguing that,

“The aim of vesting is to make me stick around and create value — not to put me in a situation where I am deprived of the opportunity to vest because I am terminated for reasons beyond my control or I resign because the environment is intolerable.

So, if I am terminated with no cause by the acquirer, I should vest all my stock. Or if the conditions at the acquirer are intolerable and I resign for good reason, I should vest all my stock.”


The risk of termination at an acquirer is much greater than the risk of termination in a startup. Investors are generally investing in the future value of a startup — they’re investing in people. Acquirers are generally investing in the existing value in a startup — they’re investing in assets.

When you sell a company, the acquirer, founders, management, and investors will renegotiate the distribution of the chips on the table. It isn’t unusual to renegotiate existing agreements whenever one party has a lot of leverage over the others. To quote the fictional Al Swearengen,

“Bidding’s open always on everyone.”


Negotiating your acceleration agreement now gives you leverage in this upcoming multi-way negotiation.

If an acquirer doesn’t like your acceleration agreement, they can decrease the purchase price and use the savings to retain you with golden handcuffs. A lower purchase price means less money for your investors. This provides you with negative leverage against your investors — you can decrease your investor’s profit if you refuse to renegotiate your acceleration.

Or, the acquirer can increase the purchase price in return for reducing your acceleration. A higher purchase price means more money for your investors. This provides you with positive leverage against your investors — you can increase your investor’s profit if you agree to renegotiate your acceleration.


After this renegotiation, the CEO and key members of the management team often end up with better acceleration agreements than everybody else. That’s not a big surprise — the CEO is leading the renegotiation.

Founders who are perceived as major contributors by the board and acquirer may also benefit from the negotiation. If you’re the Director of Engineering, you’re probably invisible to the acquirer — if you’re the VP of Engineering and involved in the negotiations, you may do much better.

As always, the best defense against these shenanigans is to create a board that reflects the ownership of the company and to make a new board seat for a new CEO.

Submit your experiences and questions regarding vesting upon a sale in the comments. We’ll discuss the most interesting ones in a future article.

A sale of the company is an example of a change in control. Your lawyers will help you define change in control. A definition that we have used in one term sheet follows.

"# Accelerate your vesting upon termination

“During the whole funding process they said, ‘We’re interested in you guys because of your management team; we think you’re fantastic…’ Two weeks later they pull me into the office – before even the first board meeting – and say, ‘We want to replace you as CEO.’”

– Mark Fletcher, Founders at Work

Summary: You made a commitment to the company by agreeing to a vesting schedule — the company should reciprocate and commit to you by granting acceleration upon termination.

Over time, your continuing contributions to the company will become relatively less important to its success. But the number of shares you vest every month will stay relatively large. Founders generally make their greatest contributions at the early stages of the business but their vesting is spread evenly over three to four years.

As your relative contribution to the company diminishes, everyone at the company has an incentive to terminate you and benefit ratably from the cancellation of your unvested shares. Nevertheless, in our experience, founders are allowed to vest in peace unless they are incompetent, actively harmful to the business, or clash with a new CEO.

By definition, a new CEO is hired to change the way things are and provide new leadership to the business. That he might clash with founders who previously ran the business is predictable. The CEO usually wins any disagreements or power struggles — he is the decider and he decides what is best.

The investors, board, and management will almost certainly agree to fire your ass if you continuously clash with a new CEO and you will lose your unvested shares upon termination.

50% to 100% of your unvested shares should accelerate if you are terminated without  cause or you resign for good reason.

Cause typically includes willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraudulent conduct, and breaches of agreements with the company. ‘Clashing with the CEO’ is not cause. Good reason typically includes a change in position, a reduction in salary or benefits, or a move to distant location. Detailed definitions are included in the Appendix below.

Make sure you receive this acceleration whether or not your termination or resignation is in connection with a change in control of the company, such as a sale of the business. You can clash with your acquirer too.



Acceleration may cause consternation among your investors but it is easy to justify:

 “A founder’s most important contributions generally occur in the early stages of a business but he earns his shares evenly over time. If I clash with a new CEO and he terminates me, I should receive the equity I earned with those contributions. Which will make me much more comfortable with hiring a new CEO.

The founders agreed to a vesting schedule to demonstrate our long-term commitment to the business. You have told us that the founders are critical to the company — that we are the DNA of the business. Acceleration demonstrates the company’s long-term commitment to our continuing contribution.”

This argument is an application of the reciprocity norm which requires your opponent to be fair to you if you are fair to him. Your vesting schedule locked you into a commitment to the company — that was fair — now acceleration locks the company into a commitment to you.

It is even easy to justify 100% acceleration if you are the sole founder of the business:

“Right now, I own 100% of my shares. After the financing, I will have to earn these shares back over the next four years — I’ve agreed to that. But if I’m removed from the business, I lose the right to earn my shares back. In that case, I should walk out the door with the shares I came in with.”

As usual, the best way to avoid unfair termination and avoid hiring a bad CEO is to create a board that reflects the ownership of the company with hacks like making a new board seat for a new CEO.

If you have a team of founders, acceleration upon termination can do more harm than good.

A co-founder with acceleration upon termination who wants to leave the company can misbehave and engender his termination. If the company decides to terminate him without cause to avoid possible lawsuits, your co-founder will walk away with a lot of shares. In California, it is actually very difficult to prove cause unless an employee engages in criminal activity.

If you trust your co-founders absolutely, you should negotiate as much acceleration upon termination as you can. Otherwise, you need to decide which is worse: the expected value of misbehaving co-founders who leave with a lot of shares or the expected value of leaving a lot of shares behind after your termination.

"# Advice is for learning not copying

“As for the advice? Lots to choose from. Think big, or maybe small.”

— John Abell, on Startup School 08

Advice is for learning, not copying. Don’t follow our advice.

Advice can be ignored. One of my favorite advisors once told the founders of YouTube that, “People don’t want to watch video on their computers.”

Advice is useful if it helps you perceive and evaluate the outcomes of today’s actions. That’s what it means to be wise. But advisors can’t be wise for you, especially since they don’t know your values, goals, and environment.

Understanding advice isn’t as useful as understanding why you’re supposed to be following it.

Advice tells you how to play the game. But there’s more than one way to play the game in chess, football, business, and life.

Advice distills the experiences of the past. But what worked yesterday will not work tomorrow. Today is not for copying the past. Today is for testing hypotheses whose outcome is unknown.

Advice asks for mimicry: “This works for me so you should do the same thing I do.” But the essence of strategy is to perform different activities than your rivals do. Strategy requires differentiation—not mimicry.

Once you’ve gathered advice, take the course that you think is best—you’re the only one who will be faced with the consequences.

“You can’t be normal and expect abnormal returns.”

"# Agile methods and startup companies… go perfectly together

William Pietri left a great comment on Books for Entrepreneurs: Agile Software Development:

“Great to see these approaches getting more attention in the startup world. I’ve been soaking in both agile methods and startup companies a long time, and I think they go perfectly together. They provide just enough structure to make everybody effective, without unnecessary constraints or process bloat.

“One of my clients, sidereel.com started with an XP-ish process from the first week. They had an alpha for investors in 2 months, a private beta in 3, and a public beta in 4 months. Now they’re happily funded, up to a dozen people, and just shy of Alexa 1000 site [emphasis added].  Weekly iterations meant they always had new progress to show potential investors. And being able to change direction easily meant they could try a lot of things out and invest heavily in areas the users liked.

“Speaking of which, I and a colleague are interested in trying out some variations of the Planning Game with a couple of user-focused startups. If any VH readers want to be guinea pigs, we’re looking for Bay Area teams that are early in the process, actively struggling to put together a product plan, and have both business and technical people involved full time. If there’s anybody here that meets those criteria, just drop me a line. My email address is my first name at my domain name [scissor.com].”

"# Always assume competition

Earlier this month, I got this email from a friend:

“Why didn’t you ever tell me about  this site? This is exactly what I was trying to create and just spent  the last few weeks pulling people together to build me a site. Do you  know how they are doing? They never once came up through my competitive  intelligence and I just learned about them. Would like to know before I  dump anymore money in my venture.”

This was my response:

“I can’t give you any insider  information on any of these companies. I know the founders of all of  them. It doesn’t matter. It has nothing to do with you. It’s good to  know the market but the competition is irrelevant. The market is big.  Winning comes by knowing the customer better, executing better, and  continuing to work on the problem after sane people have cashed out. If a competitor is going to scare you, you shouldn’t have started a business in the first place. Every big market or successful business will attract competitors anyway. Always assume competition.”

"# Are founders really 1000x more valuable than employees

Is it fair for founders to own about 100% of a startup while employee #1 only owns a few percent? Are founders 10-1000x more valuable than employees?

The answers are

In fact, many employees get better equity deals than the founders. There are two cases.

When the founders start the company, it is worth approximately $0. So their equity is worth $0.

Let’s say the founders work for 6 months, make progress, and then raise money at a $10M post. Then employee #1 joins and gets 1% of the company. So his shares are worth $100,000.

So each founder got $0 of stock when he joined the business. The employee got $100,000 of stock when he joined the business.

Every employee that joins the business gets more stock than the founders did. Not in shares, or as a percentage of the company. But in the only metric that really matters, the dollar value of stock at the time the employee joins.

That’s why some people say that anyone who joins a company before they raise money is a founder. In other words, anyone who joins the company before the stock has value to a third party, is considered to be a founder.

Some founders can raise money with nothing to show other than their smiling faces.

Let’s say the founders raise money at a $10M post-money, simultaneous with founding the company. In this case, the market is valuing the founders’ contribution at $10M.

Then the company identifies employee #1 and tries to hire her. The company will have to compete with every company in the world for that employee, and therefore the market, not the company, is setting the employee’s compensation.

Continued in Part 2.

Measuring your stock in dollars is not at odds with measuring your stock in percentages. They’re just different views on the same data. If you’re an employee at Facebook and the stock price is monotonically increasing, look at the dollar value of your stock. If you’re joining a company today and you’re trying to figure out what you get if the company sells for $100M, use percentages.

(Note: This is the first time I’m testing this argument. Be gentle.)

"# Are you selling your startups shares doortodoor

We’ve covered this before, but it’s worth repeating: don’t raise money in series, raise it in parallel.

Don’t talk to one investor at a time, talk to all of them at once. It’s the only way to get market-clearing terms.

Meeting every investor over a short period of time creates a positive feedback loop of social proof and scarcity that closes deals.

Recently, we’ve noticed a new way of making this mistake. The entrepreneur says, “I’ll use AngelList if my other intros don’t work out.”

If you can get intros on your own (and all the good startups can), you should use AngelList at the same time, not afterwards. Why?

First, no matter how good your offline network is, it’s unlikely to introduce you to the optimal investors, or help you close the deal as quickly as AngelList can.

Second, if your other intros don’t work out, AngelList probably won’t work out either — the startups that do well on AngelList are the ones that use it to complement their offline intros.

"# Ask forgiveness not permission

AngelList “corporate policy” is that team members should ask forgiveness, not permission. 

We would rather have someone do something wrong than ask permission to do it. 

Or better, we would rather have someone do something right and not need permission to do it. This is the most common outcome.

We would rather have people ship to production whenever they want, than go through an internal review process. We can fix it on production. We prefer the customer’s review process. And it isn’t too hard to reveal a new feature to a small portion of our users and iterate on it as we expand it to more users. 

Eliminating permission increases speed and diversity

Eliminating permission increases the speed and diversity of our decision-making. Our incubator applications are a good example of diverse decision-making: one of our team members built it even though I was telling him, “This is fine, but I don’t think it is that important. Why don’t you work on something else.” It ended up being very important to our users and mission. 

There are some sensitive parts of our product that are walled off from this “ask forgiveness” policy. There are some things we want reviewed by the people who “know better”. But it’s really rare. 

How it works

This policy only works if you hire insanely smart and capable people, and let go of the ones who are not. We also filter for people who are mission-oriented, care about our customer and want to learn more. 

And it doesn’t mean that the founders aren’t standing over your desk telling you, “this isn’t good enough to ship”. That’s why we write down and promote these ideas. Because there is always pressure from someone important to do it another way. 

It also wouldn’t work without these other items of corporate propaganda:

You break it, you bought it 

If you break something or your stuff is buggy, please fix it. As in straight away mate. 

Sweat the details and corner cases 

If people are going to ship whatever they want, we need them to sweat the details if they’re going to avoid mistakes.

The best way to do that is to have the rest of the team constantly complain that your code and/or design sucks or, in polite terms, “contains opportunities for improvement.”

Actually, mistakes are fine. They’re something you trade off for other variables like speed of iteration. We just want people to sweat the details because we care about the details. 

Be real

Again, if people are going to ship whatever they want, whenever they want, how do we get them to make good decisions? One answer is that we ask them to “be real”. As in, treat our users like real people. Treat your teammates like real people. Just be real and do the right thing. 

Do what you think is right (and be right)


If you have the freedom to make decisions, you also have the responsibility of being correct. 

S/he who codes, rules

Another way we promote good decisions is by pushing the decisions down to the people doing the work. We memorialize that with the motto, “s/he who codes, rules”. As in, when we disagree, the person doing the work makes the decision. 

Own the result 

Pushing the decision-making down to the worker works best if the same person is responsible for the metrics. So we try to have 1-wo/man teams whenever we can, and we ask them to own the result. We also hire people who care about our customer and want to solve problems for them.

Freedom and Responsibility

All of these dictums are variations on freedom and responsibility. Netflix has a great presentation on the topic. So does Valve. Peter Drucker probably wrote about it 50 years ago. We didn’t invent this stuff, we don’t claim to know what we’re doing, nor is this a perfectly accurate or complete model of how we operate. 

Freedom

Responsibility 

If you’re interested in working with us, we’re always hiring.

"# Before productmarket fit find passionmarket fit

Before product-market fit, find passion-market fit.

Building a product is a process, not a discrete action. And the Internet is efficiently arbitraged. Every single simple thing that can be done is being done, or has been done. The lesson of history is that product-market fit is very precise—one wrong tweak or slightly bad timing and you can miss the whole thing.

So the only way you’re likely to find product-market fit is if you’re almost irrationally obsessed with the market and if you’ve been working on it for a long time. Where the journey is the reward. Then, you’re likely to have unique insights (in the details) and consistent execution, through thick and thin, to find fit.

Often, the best companies are ones where the product is an extension of the founder’s personality, which shouldn’t be a big surprise, since everyone is passionate about themselves.

"# Bram Cohen Lawyers can’t tell you you can’t do something

Yesterday, we published Top 10 reasons why entrepreneurs hate lawyers, a sponsor post by Scott Edward Walker. Scott’s a lawyer.

First, I thought other lawyers would hate it. I was totally wrong — we got a bunch of nice comments from lawyers like well-known Silicon Valley folks Yokum Taku, Josh King, and Matt Bartus.

Second, Bram Cohen, the inventor of BitTorrent, left an awesome comment that I’m reproducing here with added emphasis:

“Thanks for the link to my tweet, Scott.

“You cover the problems very well. My particular gripe in that tweet had to do with the practice of billing up several hours to answer a question asked in email, when all that was really wanted was the answer *if* the lawyer knew it off the top of their head. Next time I start a small company I’m going to have a policy that any hours billed need to be approved in advance, after estimates of how many they will be are given.

“You’re very right about the over-lawyering, and the NVCA docs in particular. There’s no reason in principle why one couldn’t take an NVCA document verbatim and simply fill in the blanks and do a round of funding without needing a lawyer at all. The contracts which people go into when they buy a candy bar are equivalently complex, but they’re implicit and contained in the uniform commercial code, and always going with the boilerplate works for everybody.

“Associates doing work is a real problem. I’ve found that insisting that all work be done by partners results in better work for less money in the end, even though the nominal hourly rate is much higher, because an associate will bill for several hours researching a subject which the partner already knows off the top of their head.

“Not only is the biggest problem with lawyers them being deal-killers, but being general activity killers. Too many inexperienced entrepeneurs get into ‘The lawyers say we can’t do X” disease. Lawyers can’t tell you you can’t do something. They can warn you about risks, and in extreme cases tell you that something is such a bad idea you’ll need to get someone other than them to do it (although I’ve never personally been told that) but the judgment call of whether the risk is worth it is the entrepreneur’s. Since lawyers are trained in risks and don’t generally even think about the business, they always advocate being overly conservative, sometimes to ridiculous excess.

“All this sounds much more negative on lawyers than I generally feel. I view lawyers as performing a necessary function, but their costs can easily skyrocket and need to be contained, and their advice needs to be taken with a very large grain of salt. I don’t have the deep distrust for them that I have of, say, sysadmins and HR directors, who who are entrusted with running the core systems for a company and can easily get away with all kinds of stuff if they’re of dubious ethics.”

Bram, if you’re reading this, can you share more lawyer hacks and maybe tell us about your experiences with sysadmins and HR directors?

"# Chris Dixon How much seed money should I raise

Chris Dixon, serial entrepreneur and seed-stage investor:

“… You should try to answer the question: what is the biggest risk your startup is facing in the upcoming year and how can you eliminate that risk?  You should come up with your own answer but you should also talk to lots of smart people to get their take (yet another reason not to keep your idea secret).

“For consumer internet companies, eliminating the biggest risk almost always means getting ‘traction’ — user growth, engagement, etc. Traction is also what you want if you are targeting SMBs (small/medium businesses). For online advertising companies you probably want revenues. If you are selling to enterprises you probably want to have a handful of credible beta customers.

“The biggest mistake founders make is thinking that building a product by itself will be perceived as an accretive milestone [emphasis added]. Building a product is only accretive in cases where there is significant technical risk — e.g. you are building a new search engine or semiconductor.”

Read the rest of Chris’ What’s the right amount of seed money to raise? Also see our post, How do we set the valuation for a seed round?

If I had to stuff my answer to this question into one sentence, I would say: “As much as possible while keeping your dilution under 20%, preferably under 15%, and, even better, under 10%.” Raising as much as possible is especially wise for founders who aren’t experienced at developing and executing operating plans.

"# Comments Convertible debt and vesting

As usual, there were many mind-expanding comments this week—here are some of the very best.

The very lucky winner of this week’s mug for great contributions in the field of venture hacking is indicated with a subtle ball of fire.

“Anonymous” discusses his experience with getting vested for time served and how his investors “poked out” two of the company’s co-founders:


“In my first institutional round we successfully got founder vesting put in… with a year’s worth of credit and a monthly vesting rather than an annual cliff. The company was at about 16 months old. At the time, we thought we were losers and just got ripped off but in hindsight that was a genius move. When the lead VC moved to poke out two of our 3 co-founders, that vesting took away some of the sting. Having the [credit] makes them think twice about having to spend the cash to move you out. In the end, we ended up with about 12% of the company fully diluted per founder. That’s pretty damn good, especially when we were at a $650M valuation when we got poked out.

If you are EBITDA negative, you need to expect to see [vesting] in the deal. I would highly encourage you to try and fight for the value you’ve created as much as possible and look down the road at ways in which you can preserve as much of that value as possible. If you are close to break even or EBITDA positive, this should be a non-issue.”

Yokum Taku, a lawyer, mentions that co-founders can negotiate their vesting agreements before they raise financing—this provides extra leverage in the Series A negotiation:



“Negotiation microhack on vesting:

When the company is newly incorporated and founders shares are being issued (well before the VC Series A financing), consider hard-wiring some of the suggestions (vesting for time served, various acceleration provisions, etc.) into the Founders Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements.

Obviously, all of the provisions of the Founders Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements can (and will be) superceded by the Series A documents, but there’s a possibility that if you lead with something that is not outrageous in terms of vesting and acceleration, it might survive the Series A financing.

One ploy involves a response to the VCs along the lines of “Well – those vesting (and lack of acceleration) provisions are different from what the [fill in number greater than two]  founders originally agreed upon.  It took us several screaming matches to agree on upon these terms when we issued founders stock and there was a certain level of distrust during these arguments.  I don’t know if I have the stomach to go back to [fill in name of potentially unstable founder least savvy about VC terms] to explain why we want to change what we agreed upon.  He doesn’t really want to take your money in the first place, and it’ll push him over the edge.  He/she’ll think that I’m trying to screw him/her over and may blow up the deal.

Typical legal disclaimers apply to this comment.”

“ds” says that high valuation seed financings can cause problems:

“I like [convertible debt] for the reason that it preserves upside for the angels that are taking the first layer of risk.  I have seen a fair number of deals where price-insensitive angels put some $ into a company on a fairly high valuation.

Later, in the first institutional round, the VC  takes a clinical look at the business and puts a different (lower) valuation on it.  In that case, no one is happy…the entrepreneur feels he has done a lot of work and is moving backwards, the angel feels like he has taken risk and gotten stuffed, and the VC feels (to the extent that they feel) like they are dealing with unsophisticated operators.

[Convertible debt] is a neat structure to avoid this problem.”

Yokum Taku, a lawyer, considers whether convertible debt goes in the pre-money or post-money:

“One corollary to the Option Pool Shuffle is “What’s in the fully-diluted shares outstanding if you have convertible notes or warrants outstanding?”   The issue is whether shares issuable upon conversion of a convertible bridge note or warrants issued in connection with the bridge should be considered part of the pre-money fully-diluted shares outstanding in calculating price per share of the Series A.  Remember, more fully-diluted shares outstanding drives the Series A price per share down, resulting in more dilution to the founders.

Given that many companies are doing convertible note bridge financings as their seed round, this seems to come up relatively often.

VCs will take the position that all of the shares issuable upon the conversion of the bridge note and any warrants granted will be part of the denominator for calculating the price per share of the Series A.

At first glance, it seems like there is a good argument on behalf of the company that the shares issuable upon the bridge note are no different from shares issued in the Series A, and should not be included in the pre-money fully-diluted shares outstanding.  In addition, warrants issued in connection with the note typically have an exercise price equal to the Series A price, so these warrants are not dilutive like cheap founders common shares.

The response from the VC is (1) the money from the bridge is gone and the value created by that money is reflected in the pre-money valuation, so the shares issuable upon conversion of the bridge count against fully-diluted shares, (2) in any event, there is a conversion discount on the note conversion so these shares are dilutive to the Series A, and (3) even though the warrants aren’t dilutive today with an exercise price at the Series A price, they will be dilutive in the future in the next round of financing, so the pre-Series A investors should bear that dilution.

Of course, with respect to (1), if there is still money in the bank at the time of Series A, perhaps some portion of the shares issuable upon conversion of the bridge should be taken out of the pre-money fully-diluted share number to the extent of the money left in the bank.

And with respect to (2), perhaps the discount portion of the conversion shares should be included in the pre-money fully-diluted share number, but the rest (to the extent there is money left in the bank) should not.

Finally, with respect to (3), perhaps the warrant overhang is not too different from multiple closings on a Series A round, where the price is set at the first closing, and second closings seem to go on for long periods of time after the first closing at the same price per share as the first closing.

I’d be curious in the VC reaction to this, because the last time I tried this, I lost arguments (1) and (2) (with not too much more logic than “no, those shares are in the denominator” – end of argument) and item (3) warrants was not applicable…

Typical disclaimers about legal advice apply to this comment.

Aside from the swipe about startup company lawyers not negotiating hard against the VCs (which I vehemently disagree with as a WSGR partner), I think you’ve done a great job educating entrepreneurs about subtle nuances in negotiations with VCs.”

Here’s a few recent ones that are especially good. You can also subscribe to our comments RSS feed.

Joe Greenstein (from Flixster) says:

“I just want to throw in that my personal pet peeve with regard to the “standard” term sheet is the bit about the company paying the VC legal costs. C’mon – you have $500M and I am raising $1.5M and you want me to take the first $25k to pay your legal expenses for doing the deal? That’s like your dad giving you your allowance and then asking you to buy him a hot dog.

When we were raising money for flixster i thought that must be a trick — like if i agreed to that term they would pull the term sheet at the last second and say i failed the secret fiscal responsibility test…”

Andrew Parker (an Analyst at Union Square Ventures) says:

“In a negotiation, you can also try to change the rules of the game (change the formulas). For example, I know a few CEOs that have successfully negotiated that any option pool be created after the investment by institutional money, not before. So, the investors took the pool dilution along with the founders. This represents a significant increase in valuation without asking for an increase in valuation. It’s a hard chip to win in bargaining, but it’s worth taking a shot considering the high reward.”

“Anonymous” says:


“Some part of the term-sheets is like negotiating “pre nups”. You are basically negotiating the framework to follow when things go wrong or you end up in disagreement in future, just at the point where you are agreeing to work together in present.

One thing the article should expand upon is how to negotiate without scaring of the VCs. An entrepreneur has to balance protecting his interest with not coming across as someone that might be a “problem founder”. No VCs like to work with someone they perceive as a problematic founders. It is a tight rope walk!”

Suzie Dingwall Williams (a lawyer) says :


“Whatever you do, make sure that the [double] trigger runs for a period of time BEFORE as well as AFTER change of control. You want to avoid any pre-emptive house cleaning of management before the deal is done.

I still get a good deal of moral outrage from investors when I try to negotiate this provision into the deal. Their objections seem to be a knee jerk reaction to anything that might cut into their ROI on a liquidty event. As if.”

“Entrepreneur” says:

“I would like to add it is possible to raise VC money without founder vesting provisions. I recently closed a series A round for a six month old company with no founder vesting provisions. We took them out of the term sheet and they weren’t discussed again. We’ve worked previously with the same VC with great outcomes so we had a strong hand.”

“A Founder” says :


“I went to these VCs with a new CEO candidate whom I had worked with for 12 months previously. The investment proceeded and I stepped aside. Four months later I was asked if I wanted to leave and sell my shares. The offer was way below the value of the previous round so I said I would leave, but retain the shares and a board seat. However, they really wanted me gone. The deal was I would be terminated without cause, but loss of employment meant loss of board seat, which meant no ability to protect my shareholding (about 20% at that point). I was actually told by the CEO (a buddy?) that they would engineer a down round just to force me out.

Eventually we reached a compromise, but the lessons learned were:

1. Resist vesting if you have devoted time and your own capital to a business prior to VC investment.

2 Have a board seat linked to the shareholding, not the employment contract.”

Here are the latest great comments from our readers—please keep ’em coming!

Rob Lord, founder of Songbird (Sequoia Capital), has some ideas for VC Wear t-shirts:

“Mo’ money, mo’ board seats.
“409a a-okay!
“Some of my best friends are EIRs.
“Venture debt is a non-starter.”

Jonathan Boutelle, founder of SlideShare, suggests using SlideShare to share decks privately:

“One safe way to share a PowerPoint deck with potential investors: upload it to SlideShare as private. Share it only with the investor. After 48 hours (or whenever they’ve had time to check out the presentation) simply remove it from slideshare.

“You could also share via a “secret” URL: but that URL could potentially be forwarded to other parties so it’s not a good way to share files with people you don’t trust (which seems to be the challenge we’re speaking of here). Still, you could take the file down after 48 hours, and this approach wouldn’t require the other party to have a login on slideshare. So it might be the more practical option.”

 Nabeel Hyatt, founder of Conduit Labs (Charles River Ventures), says you shouldn’t send your deck to investors:

“Not worth it. Not because your deck has some amazing information, it probably is pretty high level and isn’t as unique as you wish it was, but because it kills the point of the presentation. What if Steve Jobs posted his Keynote presentation the day before Macworld and then gave his presentation the next day — how much harder would it be for him to get any sense of drama, intrigue, and frankly keep people awake?

“You should send them *something* to entice their interest, but whatever it is, expect it to be widely circulated, and think of it as just a teaser to get the meeting. You should be the main event, not your PDF.”

 Ted Rheingold, founder of Dogster (Michael Parekh), has some ideas for protecting your deck:

“Don’t forget to convert it to PDF or another read-only format to avoid any funny stuff once it has left your hands.

“And make sure the date is the day or month you sent it, as it then stands as a point-in-time snapshot which is likely out-of-date by the next quarter (in case the slides end up floating around inboxes month later)

“I like the idea of posting the recipients name on each page so it’s clear who leaked it if they do want to pass along.

“I also thinking striping out any slides you think reveal too much is a good compromise. (Ask a trusted person to be the judge of what is too revealing, company founders tend to over value their own IP)”

Yokum Taku, a partner at Wilson Sonsini, disagrees with us on capping legal fees:

“The statement “Most caps include the fees for both sides” is not accurate. Term sheets typically only say that the company will pay reasonable legal fees of investors’ counsel, capped at $X. (I also disagree with $10K – $20K as a reasonable cap to propose with straight face for investor counsel.) Of course, you can try to discuss a fee cap with company counsel, but almost all competent counsel will not agree to a cap. However, most experienced counsel can provide estimates based on actual data from previous similar transactions. Companies often have neglected corporate cleanup that needs to be fixed in connection with a financing (similar to not going to the dentist for years and paying the price later). In addition, there are always things that occur in financings that are difficult to predict (such as arguments among founders). Finally, capping company counsel fees is a disincentive to provide services after the cap is exceeded.”

 Farbood Nivi, founder of Grockit (Benchmark Capital), thinks raising a good chunk of money is not a bad thing:

“There is an argument that says too much money can cause one to take the foot off the gas.

“I can’t say it’s a false statement. I can say it doesn’t make sense to me or apply in Grockit’s situation. Raising the Series A we did, as opposed to a few hundred K seed round, has given us an engine with a lot more horsepower. That knowledge, if anything, should keep your foot feeling like lead. That said, keep in mind, a more powerful car requires more adept steering, braking and maintenance.

“Money well spent buys time (far more precious than money), quality (translate: scalability and user satisfaction), people (translate: your company), access, resources. Do you need any of these?

“Money is to a business what oxygen is to a human…

“All founders are desperate. The question is what for.

“I would rather be able to pursue my desperate need to create the ass-kickinest app I can over my desperate need to generate revenue for it.

“Money allows you to reduce revenue based desperation and replace it with product building desperation.”

"# Complete business diligence before you sign a term sheet

“Once the term sheet is signed, the power shifts away from the startup to the purchaser. The typical term sheet will give the purchaser the discretion to step away from the deal if due diligence is unsatisfactory, or if the necessary internal approvals are not obtained.”

— Suzanne Dingwall Williams, on M&A

“… there is a wide range of behavior among VCs—the group that doesn’t put a term sheet down until they are committed are at one end of the spectrum; the group that puts down a term sheet to try to lock up a deal while they think about whether or not they want to do it is at the other.”

— Brad Feld

Summary: Complete business diligence and prepare for legal diligence before you sign a term sheet. Signing a term sheet early is a recipe for a hostage negotiation.

A reader asks:

“Our term sheet says ‘any obligation on the part of the investors is subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence by the prospective investors.’ How much diligence should we do before signing the term sheet?”

Whether or not your term sheet includes this term, complete business diligence and prepare for legal diligence before you sign a term sheet.

Signing a term sheet, with or without a no-shop agreement, while an investor is still conducting business diligence, is a recipe for a hostage negotiation:

You sign a term sheet, let other investors know, and go off the market while your prospective investors do diligence. After 2-4 weeks, your prospective investors say, “Uh, yeah, the results of diligence weren’t so good, we’ll still do the deal but with these (worse) terms instead.”

While you’ve been off the market, your prospective investors have been creating alternatives by looking at other companies. Every company that is raising money, not just your competitors in the marketplace, is competing for your prospective investor’s time and money. Meanwhile, the market your created before signing a term sheet has dissipated.

Even if you turn down these worse terms and approach new investors, you will have to explain why you walked away from a signed term sheet. So, before you sign a term sheet, complete business diligence and prepare for legal diligence.

Business diligence is whatever your investor needs to make his investment decision. Some firms complete business diligence before they offer a term sheet. Other firms offer term sheets before they complete business diligence because they want to lock out the competition while they evaluate the company.

Determine whether business diligence is complete by asking:

After you sign a term sheet, investors conduct legal diligence, looking for reasons to not invest or reasons to revise the terms.

Legal diligence,

Before you sign a term sheet, help your prospective investor eliminate most reasons  to not invest by,

You: “It must be great to complete diligence before signing a term sheet—but we’re desperate for money right now.”

Venture Hacks Shift Manager: That’s the worst reason to rush into a term sheet. Signing a term sheet before completing business diligence makes you more desperate, not less. A term sheet with or without a no-shop takes you off the market, dissipates your market, and places you at the mercy of your prospective investor.

"# Control is a one way street

Summary: Control is a one way street that runs towards investors. Control doesn’t run backwards toward founders or common stockholders. In each round of financing, the percentage of investor board seats goes up (or stays the same). Once the investors have more board seats than the common, you’ve lost control of the board and you’re never getting it back. Your best bet is to be stingy with board seats and hope you never have to raise a round without good leverage.

An interesting idea came up in a meeting with Mike Speiser last week:

Control is a one way street.

In startups, control is a one way street that runs towards investors. Control doesn’t run backwards toward founders or common stockholders (unless you create dual-class stock when you IPO).

Here’s how control shifts to investors with each round of financing:

The Board: In each round of financing, the percentage of investor board seats goes up (or stays the same). And the percentage of common board seats goes down (or stays the same). In each round, the common can only hope to maintain their percentage of board seats.

Protective Provisions and Class votes: In each round of financing, the number of investors who participate in protective provisions and class votes goes up (or stays the same). That means you’ll have to ask more investors for their consent to do things like sell the company.

Shareholders: In each round of financing, the percentage of company shares held by investors goes up (obviously).

Class votes, shareholder votes, and the exercise of protective provisions are rare compared to board actions. The board meets about once a month to approve management decisions—so let’s take a closer look at the board.

Here’s an example of how board control shifts to investors with each round:

Founding: The founders have all the board seats. Let’s say the board consists of 2 founders.

Seed: The founders keep all the board seats.

Series A:  The investors gain two board seats, an independent joins the board, and the founders don’t gain any board seats. Let’s say the board is now 2 investors, 2 founders, and 1 independent.

Series B: The company has a tough time raising money so the investors gain one more board seat but the founders don’t. The board is now 3 investors, 1 independent, and 2 founders. The investors now control the board.

In each round of financing, the percentage of common board seats stayed the same or went down. Don’t count independent directors when you’re calculating the percentage of common board seats—you don’t know how the independent director will vote.

Here are some facts to consider when you’re giving board seats to investors:

Your best bet is to be stingy with board seats and hope you never have to raise a round without good leverage:

Control is a one way street. You have to go down the road to raise money—but be wise about how far you go.

"# Create a board that reflects the ownership of the company

“Good boards don’t create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.”

– Old Silicon Valley Saying

Summary: Create a board of directors that reflects the ownership of the company and don’t let your investors control the board through an independent board seat.

The composition of the board of directors is the most important element of the Series A investment. It is more important than the valuation of your company.

The valuation of your company won’t matter to you if the board

If it isn’t obvious by now, a bad board can do lots of stupid or malicious things to make your stock or company worthless.

The board you create will be your new boss. But trying to please everyone on your board dooms you to managing board members and ignoring customers and employees. Great companies are rarely built by committee and a bad board will waste your time trying to run the company their way.

This hack will show you how to create a board of directors that you can trust even when you don’t agree with its decisions.

The form of government in a company is dictatorship. The board represents the owners of the company and selects the dictator (CEO).  The board then works to ensure the dictator is optimally benevolent towards the owners. Naturally, bad dictators get beheaded…

If the board represents the owners of the company, its composition should reflect the ownership of the company. Truly competitive and transparent markets, such as the public stock markets, have already reached this conclusion.

After the Series A investment has closed, the common stockholders are probably going to own most of the company. The common stockholders should therefore elect most of the board seats. Let’s assume the common stockholders own approximately 60% of the company after the Series A. If you’re taking money from two investors, the board should look like

3 common  + 2 investors  = 5 members.

And if you’re taking money from one investor, the board should look like

2 common + 1 investor = 3 members.

In either case, the common stock should elect its directors through plurality voting. Plurality voting enables the founders to elect all of the common seats if they control a majority of the common stock.

The sound bite you want to use in your negotiation is

“The common stock owns most of the company. Isn’t ownership the basis for determining the composition of the board?  One share, one vote?”

Your investors may argue that this board structure leaves their preferred stock exposed to the machinations and malfeasance of the common board members. Your response should be

“Isn’t that why we’re giving you protective provisions?”

Early-stage companies with good leverage can negotiate this democratic board structure in a Series A. If your investors tell you that a democratic board is a deal-breaker and you want to move forward with them, use the fallback position: an investor-leaning board.

An investor-leaning board looks like this:

2 investors:  2 common  + 2 investors + 1 independent = 5 seats

or

1 investor: 1 common + 1 investor + 1 independent = 3 seats.

An investor-leaning board gives an equal number of seats to every class of stock, no matter how many shares that class owns. This makes no sense, but, hey! that’s venture capital! There are many future scenarios where your investors can take over this board (e.g. a down round or hiring a new CEO), but there are no realistic scenarios where the common stockholders take over this board. Hence, this board is investor-leaning.

If you end up with an investor-leaning board, get your investors to agree to create a new common seat anytime the company creates a new investor seat (e.g. for the Series B investor). This prevents the investors from taking over the board in the Series B as long as this term isn’t renegotiated.

If you have a strong BATNA, you should reject anything less than an investor-leaning board. If your prospective investors suggest anything worse, they are probably trying to take advantage of you.

Don’t let the investors control the board through the independent seat. They may suggest a big shot for the independent seat whom you can’t decline without looking like a fool.

But the big shot does a lot more business with VCs than he is likely to do with you. VCs regularly refer the big shot to promising companies. The big shot invests in various venture funds and startups that the VCs send his way. Perhaps the big shot was an entrepreneur-in-residence at the investor’s firm. Where do you think the big shot’s loyalties lie?

Most likely, the big shot will be aligned with your investors.

The simplest solution to this dilemma is to fill the independent seat before the financing. At a minimum, select someone whom you trust and has the credibility to fill the seat. The investors will have a tough time replacing this independent director if your selection is a big shot himself or if he introduced the company to the venture firm in the first place.

If you can’t select the independent director until after the financing, the simplest solution is to

"# Create a market for your shares

“Things are worth what people pay for them.”

– Head of M&A at a Fortune 500 Company

Summary: You need strong alternatives to hack a term sheet. Create alternatives with focus: pitch and negotiate with all your prospective investors at once. Focus compounds scarcity and social proof, which closes deals. Focus also yields a quick yes or no from investors—either way, you will soon get back to building your business.

You can’t hack a term sheet without leverage. Term sheets are negotiated on the basis of leverage, not merit. And whoever needs the deal least has the most leverage in a negotiation.

The simplest type of leverage is a great BATNA. A great BATNA might be a term sheet from another investor, an offer to buy your company, or an investment from angels instead of VCs.

Hostage negotiators learn how to negotiate with awful BATNAs where people die in a hail of bullets. If you’re not in the mood for a hostage negotiation, get a great BATNA by creating a market for your shares.

Many entrepreneurs wonder what their company is worth. The incredible answer is: companies are worth what people pay for them.

There is no right or wrong price. The market clearing price is determined by supply and demand: how many shares you’re selling, your team, your product, your revenue, your salesmanship, et cetera.

The market determines your value, but there is no market for your shares—you must create it. How? At a minimum, get two independent, competing offers from investors who make it a habit to invest in startups at your stage.

Pitch all your prospective investors  at the same time. Negotiate with all interested investors at the same time.  You can’t clear the market in series, you can only clear it in parallel. Learn from Adam Smith at Xobni:

“Our series A didn’t happen quickly. We excited the people we met with, but we were timid about getting started having recently closed a $100k angel round. One firm had interest, so we thought “We better talk to someone else to make sure we’re getting a good deal.” That incremental approach went on for a few months. We were always in late stages with one investor but just beginning the dialogue with another. Deciding to raise money should be an atomic decision; don’t try to just dip your toe in.”

Jump on your desk, kick something, and declare a start to your fund-raising. Don’t negotiate consecutively, negotiate concurrently—you can’t create a market by meeting investors one-at-a-time. The only way to clear the market is to focus on fund-raising and talk to a lot of investors at once.

On eBay, everybody bids at the same time, over a short and arbitrary period of time. That drives the price up. They don’t bid one-at-a-time over a timespan of ‘whenever’.



The next few hacks will cover the five major milestones of fund raising:

Your leverage goes up at each milestone—that is, your interest in new prospective investors goes down at each step.

Investors move in herds that are steered by scarcity and social proof. Scarcity is “hurry up or the deal is going to disappear.” It engenders urgency. Social proof is “everyone else wants to invest, don’t you?” It engenders validity.

Scarcity and social proof make people crazy. Scarcity and social proof close deals. Focusing on fund-raising creates a positive feedback loop of scarcity and social proof:

If one investor wants to invest, you get a little bit of scarcity and social proof. That raises the interest of a second investor and creates more scarcity and social proof. Which raises the interest of a third investor…

Learn more about the psychology of negotiation in Bargaining for Advantage. It combines the negotiation principles of Getting to Yes with the psychological principles of Influence. Chapter 6 of Bargaining for Advantage, “Leverage”, is free money.

Focusing your fund raising on a short period of time (about 4-8 weeks) means you will raise money quickly. Or you will fail quickly and start working on getting past no.  Either way, you’re no longer raising money, you’re back to building your company and serving your customers.

"# Customer Development Classes 3 and 4

We’ve gotten a lot of requests to keep posting Steve Blank‘s customer development course. Thanks for the feedback, we’re glad you like the course! Here’s the audio and slides from classes three and four. And new students can catch up on Class 1 and Class 2.

Steve’s lectures usually have two parts: a group discussion of a case and a lecture. Steve sprinkles his war stories throughout both parts — those are my favorite parts of the class.

A case is a written history of a real business problem that the students try to “solve”. For example, the E Ink case addresses “How to retain E Ink’s creativity, drive, and sense of fun while focusing the company on growth and the demands of a first-product introduction.” Exciting! Steve wisely ignores the specific problem in each case and subverts the material to foment a discussion about customer development.

The readings for each class are listed in the syllabus. And the main text for the class is Steve’s must-read book, Four Steps to the Epiphany.

This is wonderful material for entrepreneurs. I’ve already taken the class and I still subscribe to the Venture Hacks podcast and listen to the classes on my iPhone.

There is no audio for this class.

"# Daddy whats a soft circle

Brad Feld recently proposed good criteria to distinguish true followers from tire-kickers when you’re raising money:

 “While you can’t contractually commit the supporting investors [followers], you can usually separate the real ones from the tire-kickers (or—more generously—the call option people).  Committed supporting investors are going to let you use their names with potential lead investors, will engage in active networking, and will name a specific amount they are willing to invest.

“These supporting investors are typically called “soft circles”—you’ve got a commitment from them, but it’s not a legally binding one.  A soft circle will always have a dollar amount attached to it [emphasis added].”

True followers will also make strong introductions to potential leads.

After searching through the Venture Hacks archives, I realized one of our posts already covers it: How much diligence should we do before signing a term sheet? I think that post mostly stands the test of time—problem solved.

I revised the post to include this question for prospective investors:

“Do you agree with our plan for the next two/three/four quarters?”

“I’m an entrepreneur looking for seed investment. All I have right now is an idea and a pitch. I’m presently pitching friends and family and it has been very positive. Do you know any other idea investors I should approach?”

Larry and Sergey had a product and traction before they got their first check from an angel. Investors want to see products and preferably traction unless you already have a significant track record. But,

If you have no traction, track record, or product—if you have nothing but an idea for a product in a large market, the only people who will meet you are:

These investors sometimes have little to no experience investing in companies, but that is not an insurmountable hurdle. You will need traction, a track record, or a product to get meetings with other traditional seed stage investors.

In general, the more you need money, the less likely you are to get it. But making something out of nothing is what entrepreneurs do.

There are a few funds like Y Combinator, Seedcamp, and TechStars who will look at applications from anybody doing anything. But you will probably need traction, a track record, or a compelling product to capture their interest—ideas need not apply.

Salesmen are good at getting people to comply with their wishes. That’s what it means to be a salesman. Great salesmen can get meetings and raise money with just a large market and an idea (and maybe a sprinkling of track record).

"# Everything you ever wanted to know about advisors Part 1

Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about advisors. If you have additional questions, email us at ask@venturehacks.com.

General (answers follow)

Compensation (in Part 2)

They provide advice, introductions, investment, and social proof. Any combination of these is useful, except for an advisor who just provides social proof—savvy folks don’t take those advisors seriously.

A “board” of advisors is not a formal legal entity like a board of directors, which is defined in the Constitution and shit. You don’t need a board to collect advisors.

Create a board if it makes you and your advisors happy. Perhaps some advisors feel fancy if they’re on a board. But it really doesn’t mean anything.

Ask questions. I usually ask questions about my immediate goals for the next day and week. This sounds obvious but most people simply don’t know how to get good advice and apply it.

Some entrepreneurs set up quarterly advisory board meetings and that probably works well for them. But we find savvy entrepreneurs tend to be transactional—they ping their advisors as needed and skip the advisory board meetings.

Don’t follow advice. Instead, learn from your advisor and apply the lessons to your company.

Your advisor isn’t you: he doesn’t have your goals, history, or strengths and weaknesses. He doesn’t know your company like you do. So take the advice and apply it to your specific situation. This is the advisor paradox: hire advisors for good advice but don’t follow it, apply it.

Even good advisors may guide you with conventional wisdom. And startups are about applying unconventional wisdom. Your task is to hire the maverick advisors in the crowd.

“You can’t be normal and expect abnormal returns.”

– Jeffrey Pfeffer, The Human Equation

From your network and cold calls. There is no magic solution. Hiring advisors is an ongoing effort. Start now and continue until you’re dead.

If you’re working on something interesting, smart people will offer to help you. The contrapositive is also true: if smart people don’t offer to help you, you’re probably not working on something interesting.

Personally, I’m always asking people for advice. I try to turn the folks that give great answers into advisors.

Try before you buy. Most advice is awful. Including advice from successful entrepreneurs. (Successful people probably have an intrinsic lead on making introductions though—they tend to have better networks.)

If you’re considering a prospective advisor, (i) talk to his other advisees and find out exactly what he’s done for them, and (ii) get some advice or introductions first. Then hire him if you like the results. No worthwhile advisor will resist this test.

You can gauge the quality of advice by asking questions (see above). Does the prospective advisor give you the best answers you have ever heard? Could he teach a course at Harvard on the topic? Would you invest in him? If no, move on. If yes, engage him and squeeze his brain dry.

"# Everything you ever wanted to know about advisors Part 2

Here are more frequently asked questions about advisors. See Part 1 for the rest. If you have more questions, email us at ask@venturehacks.com.

General (from Part 1)


Compensation (answers follow)


Nothing—get them to pay you. Ask advisors to invest. You get money, save stock, and amplify the advisor’s social proof in the process. But lots of good advisors can’t or won’t invest, so…

Advisors are not paid by the hour—they’re paid for results. They’re not paid for their inputs—they’re paid for their outputs. If an advisor can uncork a million dollars of your company’s latent value with 15 minutes of conversation or a single introduction, you should pay him appropriately.

There are roughly two types of advisors—we’ll call them the normal advisor and the super advisor.

The normal advisor gets 0.1%-0.25% of a company’s post-Series A stock. Normal advisors do something important for the company and aren’t expected to do much beyond that. For example, they introduce the company to a key customer or investor.

Normal advisors are also assembled by naive entrepreneurs who think the mere presence of an advisory board will create social proof and help them raise money. But investors don’t take these mock advisory boards seriously.

The super advisor can get as much stock as a board member: 1%-2% of a company’s post-Series A stock. Super advisors help make your company happen. They know all your prospective customers intimately. Or they raise your money for you. Or they bring you a handful of great employees. They can even add more value than an independent board member because they don’t have to deal with corporate governance.

If you find a super advisor, you want to incent him as much as possible and push him to help make the company happen. They can be much more effective than 5 or 10 normal advisors.

Most super advisors are unique and Y Combinator is a great example. YC takes about 6% of a company in return for $15K-$20K. Although most of their companies can survive with the small investment, the money is effectively meaningless—it’s an artifice. Most of their companies would probably give 6% of their shares to YC for free, just to participate in the program.

YC acts like a super advisor, not an investor—and YC makes their companies happen by helping develop the company’s product, introducing them to investors, and branding their companies.

Whether you’re hiring a normal advisor or super advisor:

Finally, there is a beauty to paying in equity rather than an equivalent amount of cash. If you pay for a service in cash and you want that service again, you have to pay again. If you pay in equity, you pay once and keep getting served ad infinitum. Equity is the gift that keeps on giving. Your shareholders own you, but you also own them.

Advisory shares are normal common stock. There is no legal concept of ‘advisory shares’. The Supreme Court has never heard a case regarding advisory shares. Chief Justice Roberts doesn’t give a shit about advisory shares.

“Make sure that, for the people that count to you, you count to them.”

— Warren Buffett

If someone helps your company succeed, it is only fair to share that success with them. If you want to do repeat business with people, you need to treat them right the first time around.

Equity also keeps advisors on the hook: you can go back to them again and again for help. If they were helpful once, they can probably be helpful again. And people with a financial interest in your future tend to return your calls.

Equity also incents advisors to keep working for you in the background whether or not you ask them to. They’ll bring you leads for customers, employees, and investors.

If you’re an advisor, don’t do it for the money. The opportunity cost is probably too high. You want to get paid so (1) you can own a little piece of the company in case it happens to be the next Google and (2) so the company signals that it values your time and contribution.

Advisors can get terminated when they don’t add value at the level they originally agreed to. They can also get terminated if the company is “reset”, e.g.

“Board members and (good) investors are always de facto advisors.”

— Paul Graham

Angels or seed investors may ask for advisory shares. They might argue that they will be more helpful than the other investors, so they should get advisory shares.

But every investor thinks he will add more value than the other investors. We would like to propose a shareholder’s code of conduct: if you think you’re doing too much, you’re probably just doing your share.

So, how do you decide whether you should give advisory shares to an investor?

First, determine how many shares you would give him if he were just an advisor. Then subtract the number of shares he is buying with his investment. If the balance is significant, say, more than 50% of the shares he is buying, give him the balance in advisory shares. If the balance is under 25%, the additional shares won’t really matter to the investor and they aren’t worth the trouble of trying to justify the advisory shares to the other investors.

(This is why you never give advisory shares to venture capitalists nor do they ask for them: the balance for VCs is zero since they are buying so much of the company anyway.)

If the balance is not significant, you should just say no:

“All of our investors will be advising the company. That’s what good investors do. If I gave you advisory shares, I would have to give them to all the investors. And that wouldn’t make any sense—our valuation already takes the investor’s value-add into account.”

But if the balance is significant, you need an argument that makes sense to the other investors or they will also ask for advisory shares and lower your effective valuation:

“We want to hire him as an advisor. Fortunately, we don’t have to give him all the shares for free because he’s also going to invest as much as he can.”

You have to be able to convince the other investors—that’s the test. Or you can just “burn the boats at the shore” and give the advisory shares to the investor with the agreement that he will invest a minimum amount in the financing.

"# Financings are blowing up

“Financings are blowing up, terms are being renegotiated, venture lenders are getting more conservative, and existing investors are stepping up to fill the gaps…

“I guarantee that there are some financings happening right now that are getting done at valuations which would have made sense nine months ago but don’t make sense right now… I also guarantee that there are some financings happening right now that are getting done at valuations at half or even less of what they would have commanded nine months ago, even though the public markets have only gone down about 33% year to date.

“You can look to the public markets for some clues, and everyone I know is doing that, but it will only help so much. We are going to have to make up a lot of this as we go along. But I know one thing for sure. Capital has gotten more expensive in the past month (actually it started getting more expensive late last year) and we all had better reflect that in our plans and strategies.”

– Fred Wilson, Union Square Ventures

This is consistent with my observations and discussions with investors. Investors are looking at the public markets and renegotiating terms or pulling offers altogether. Their argument goes along the lines of “Google is worth less today and therefore so are you.” If you were a smart-ass, you would reply, “We didn’t come up with that valuation, you did.” But that won’t get you far if you don’t have leverage.

"# Five whys Part 1 The startup immune system

“When confronted with a problem, have you ever stopped and asked why five times?”

– Taiichi Ohno

Summary: Whenever you find a defect, ask why five times to discover the root cause of the problem. Then make corrections at every level of the analysis. By applying five whys whenever you find a defect, you will (1) uncover the human problems beneath technical problems and (2) build an immune system for your startup.

This is a guest post by Eric Ries, a founder of IMVU and an advisor to Kleiner Perkins. Eric also has a great blog called Startup Lessons Learned.

Taiichi Ohno was one of the inventors of the Toyota Production System. His book, Toyota Production System, is a fascinating read, even though it’s decidedly non-practical. After reading it, you might not even realize that there are cars involved in Toyota’s business. Yet there is one specific technique that I learned most clearly from this book: asking why five times. I believe this is a critical lean startup technique.

When something goes wrong, we tend to see it as a crisis and seek to blame. A better way is to see it as a learning opportunity. Not in the existential sense of general self-improvement. Instead, we can use the technique of asking why five times to get to the root cause of the problem and make corrections.

Here’s how it works. Let’s say you notice that your website is down. Obviously, your first priority is to get it back up. But as soon as the crisis is past, have the discipline to conduct a post-mortem in which you start asking why:

So far, this isn’t very different from the kind of analysis any competent operations team would conduct for a site outage. The next step is this: you have to commit to making a proportional investment in corrective action at every level of the analysis. So, in the example above, we’d have to take five corrective actions:

I have come to believe that this technique should be used for all kinds of defects, not just site outages. Each time, we use the defect as an opportunity to find out what’s wrong with our process, and make a small adjustment.

By continuously adjusting, we eventually build up a robust series of defenses that prevent problems from happening. This approach is at the heart of breaking down the “time/quality/cost, pick two” paradox, because these small investments cause the team to go faster over time.

In the example above, what started as a technical problem actually turned out to be a human and process problem. This is completely typical. Our bias as technologists is to focus on the product part of the problem, and five whys tends to counteract that tendency.

It’s why, at my previous job, we were able to get a new engineer completely productive on their first day. We had a great on-boarding process, complete with a mentoring program and a syllabus of key ideas to be covered. Most engineers would ship code to production on their first day.

We didn’t start with a great program like that, nor did we spend a lot of time all at once investing in it. Instead, five whys kept leading to problems caused by an improperly trained new employee, and we’d make a small adjustment. Before we knew it, we stopped having those kinds of problems altogether.

So it’s important to remember the proportional investment part of the rule above. It’s easy to decide that when something goes wrong, a complete ground-up rewrite is needed. It’s part of our tendency to focus on the technical and to overreact to problems.

If you have a severe problem, like a site outage, that costs your company tons of money or causes lots of person-hours of debugging, go ahead and allocate about that same number of person-hours or dollars to the solution.

The budget for corrections should be, in total, proportional to the cost of the defect that triggered the five whys. So, if the site was down and five people burned a whole day on it, maybe five man-days of fixing is appropriate. But if the problem cost three customers 25 cents each, maybe only a few hours is appropriate.

But always have a maximum, and always have a minimum. For small problems, just move the ball forward a little bit. Don’t over-invest. If the problem recurs, five whys will give you a little more budget to move the ball forward some more. You can keep your cool because five whys will be there if the problem recurs.

In Part 2, I’ll describe how to get started with five whys.

"# Five whys Part 2 How to get started

“For every dollar spent in failure, learn a dollar’s worth of lesson.”

– Jesse Robbins, Amazon’s former Master of Disaster

Summary: Get started with five whys by applying it to a specific team with a specific problem. Select a five whys master to conduct a post mortem with everyone who was involved in the problem. Email the results of the analysis to the whole company. Repeatedly applying five whys at IMVU created a startup immune system that let our developers go faster by reducing mistakes.

This is a guest post by Eric Ries, a founder of IMVU and an advisor to Kleiner Perkins. Eric also has a great blog called Startup Lessons Learned.

In Part 1, I described how to use five whys to discover the root cause of problems, make corrections, and build an immune system for your startup. So…

I recommend that you start with a specific team and a specific class of problems. For my first time, it was scalability problems and our operations team. But you can start almost anywhere—I’ve run this process for many different teams.

Start by having a single person be the five whys master. This person will run the post mortem whenever anyone on the team identifies a problem.

But don’t let the five whys master do it by himself; it’s important to get everyone who was involved with the problem (including those who diagnosed or debugged it) into a room together. Have the five whys master lead the discussion and give him or her the power to assign responsibility for the solution to anyone in the room.

Once that responsibility has been assigned, have that new person email the whole company with the results of the analysis. This last step is difficult, but I think it’s very helpful. Five whys should read like plain English. If they don’t, you’re probably obfuscating the real problem.

The advantage of sharing this information widely is that it gives everyone insight into the kinds of problems the team is facing, but also insight into how those problems are being tackled. If the analysis is airtight, it makes it pretty easy for everyone to understand why the team is taking some time out to invest in problem prevention instead of new features.

If, on the other hand, it ignites a firestorm—that’s good news too. Now you know you have a problem: either the analysis is not airtight, and you need to do it over again, or your company doesn’t understand why what you’re doing is important. Figure out which of these situations you’re in, and fix it.

Over time, here’s my experience with what happens.

People get used to the rhythm of five whys, and it becomes completely normal to make incremental investments. Most of the time, you invest in things that otherwise would have taken tons of meetings to decide to do.

You’ll start to see people from all over the company chime in with interesting suggestions for how you could make things better. Now, everyone is learning together—about your product, process, and team. Each five whys email is a teaching document.

Let me show you what this looked like after a few years of practicing five whys in the operations and engineering teams at IMVU. We had made so many improvements to our tools and processes for deployment, that it was pretty hard to take the site down. We had five strong levels of defense:

So if you had been able to sneak into the desk of any of our engineers, log into their machine, and secretly check in an infinite loop on some highly-trafficked page, somewhere between 10 and 20 minutes later, they would have received an email with a message more-or-less like this:

“Dear so-and-so, thank you so much for attempting to check in revision 1234. Unfortunately, that is a terrible idea, and your change has been reverted. We’ve also alerted the whole team to what’s happened, and look forward to you figuring out what went wrong. Best of luck, Your Software.”

OK, that’s not exactly what it said. But you get the idea.

Having this series of defenses was helpful for doing five whys. If a bad change got to production, we’d have a built-in set of questions to ask: Why didn’t the automated tests catch it? Why didn’t the cluster immune system reject it? Why didn’t operations get paged? And so forth.

And each and every time, we’d make a few more improvements to each layer of defense. Eventually, this let us do deployments to production dozens of times every day, without significant downtime or bug regressions.

In Part 3, I’ll show you how to apply five whys to “legacy” startups.

"# Five whys Part 3 Legacy startups

“We can acquire knowledge from doing something incorrectly, but only if we can determine the cause of the error and correct it.”

– Russell Ackoff

Summary: It’s never too late to start applying five whys, even if you’re saddled with zillions of lines of legacy code. Just start asking why whenever you find a problem—you’ll automatically start fixing the 20% of underlying issues that cause 80% of your problems. Five whys was first discovered by Toyota—if it can work for cars, it can work for you.

This is a guest post by Eric Ries, a founder of IMVU and an advisor to Kleiner Perkins. Eric also has a great blog called Startup Lessons Learned.

In Part 1, I described how to use five whys to discover the root cause of problems, make corrections, and build an immune system for your startup. In Part 2, I explained how to get started with five whys and how IMVU built a startup immune system by applying five whys for months and years. In this final part, I’ll describe how to apply five whys to legacy startups.

When I explain five whys to entrepreneurs and big-company types alike, I sometimes get this response: “Well, sure, if you start out with all those great tools, processes and TDD from the beginning, that’s easy! But my team is saddled with zillions of lines of legacy code and… and…”

So let me say for the record: we didn’t start with any of this at IMVU. We didn’t even practice TDD across our whole team. We’d never heard of five whys, and we had plenty of “agile skeptics” on the team. By the time we started doing continuous integration, we had tens of thousands of lines of code that wasn’t under test coverage.

But the great thing about five whys is that it has a Pareto principle built right in. Because the most common problems keep recurring, your prevention efforts are automatically focused on the 20% of your product that needs the most help. That’s also the same 20% that causes you to waste the most time. So five whys pays for itself awfully fast, and it makes life noticeably better almost right away. All you have to do is get started.

So thank you, Taiichi Ohno. I think you would have liked seeing all the waste we’ve been able to drive out of our systems and processes, all in an industry that didn’t exist when you started your journey at Toyota.

And I especially thank you for proving that this technique can work in one of the most difficult and slow-moving industries on earth: automobiles. You’ve made it hard for any of us to use the most pathetic excuse of all: “Surely, that can’t work in my business, right?” If it can work for cars, it can work for you.

What are you waiting for?

"# Focus on your share price not your valuation

Summary: Focus on your share price and the number of shares you own — metrics like valuation and percent ownership can fool you.

If valuation is your only pespective on a company’s capital structure, you can get fooled by games like the option pool shuffle which make your valuation seem large but actually depress your share price.

The most naive shareholders focus on the quantity of shares they own. That’s a mistake. The company can double your share quantity with a simple stock split. Do you feel rich now? We know companies that have 200M shares outstanding after the Series A just to fool their employees!

Merely uneducated shareholders focus on the percentage of the company they own. News flash: owning 99% of a company that is worth $10 is not going to make you rich.

Experienced shareholders (and Venture Hacks readers) focus on the current value of their shares and the company’s prospects. Investors in public companies with wacky capital structures don’t fancy that they own 0.0003% of a company that is worth $1B. Instead, they multiply today’s share price by the quantity of their shares to determine their share value. They track percentage ownership and valuation, but they focus on share price.

You should do the same:


Understand how any proposed change to the company’s capital structure affects the share price.

The number of options that new hires receive drops quickly as the value of the company increases and risk decreases. But the value of these options declines much more slowly because the increase in share price partially compensates for the reduction in share quantity.

On the other hand, if the share price is going down, the CEO and other “key” members of the management team often receive more shares to boost their share value — particularly after a new financing with inside investors.

The employees and founders who are left out of this little party should crash it.

These terms are negotiated in a simple Series A:


p = pre-money ($)
c = cash invested ($)
o = option pool size post-money (%)


and we hope you already know this:

x = existing shares outstanding (shares).

With these known values, it is easy to calculate all the unknowns:

"# Free ideas Just add execution

Go read Mike Speiser’s new blog: Laserlike. Its theme is, “Free ideas. Just add execution.”

Mike recently joined Sutter Hill Ventures as a Managing Director. Before that, he founded Epinions with fellow Venture Hacker Naval Ravikant and founded Bix (acquired by Yahoo).

In his second post, Mike writes,

“The theme of Laserlike is that ideas are overvalued.  Entrepreneurs spend too much time worrying about protecting their ideas and not enough time launching them!

“I’m going to share my thoughts during my presentation at TiEcon this Friday at 11am, during which I am going to “give away” three of my favorite ideas.  I will then blog about those ideas in more detail after the presentation and will continue sharing and discussing ideas openly on Laserlike in the future.”

My favorite idea on his blog is Shadow Market: Money management by the masses.

Make sure you read Mike’s TiEcon presentation (pdf). The section on execution is invaluable. Here are some of my favorite snippets:

“The real cost of a startup is not career risk, but rather the amount of time and psychic energy they consume.”

“Startups launch to the world too quickly and then lose some of their natural advantage of flexibility by inheriting backward compatibility.”

“Apply the same filter on your investors as you do on your founders.”

“If you have traction, you have a good deal of leverage. Even if you don’t have traction, you are better off boot strapping than going into a long‐term business partnership with the wrong person or firm.”

“While it’s possible to invent a massive new market at the same time as building the market leader in that market, it’s a low probability bet.”

“The winner in your market will likely be the one with the best leader.  A startup CEO needs to convince people to make “irrational” bets with their own lives.  He needs to convince customers to be early adopters.  He usually needs to raise capital and manage risk averse investors.  A great group of people with a weak CEO will lose.  A strong CEO has a strong grasp of strategy, can sell anything to anyone, and can inspire people to do what they never realized they could achieve.”

"# Get vested for time served

“By the time we did the financing we had been working on [the company for] 2 years, but they only vested us a year. So, they got a year of free vesting from us.” 

– Joe Kraus, Founders at Work

Summary: Don’t agree to vest all of your shares just because it is supposedly “standard”. Get vested for time served building the business.
Your Series A investors will ask you to give all your founder’s shares back to the company and earn your shares back over four years. This is called vesting — see Brad Feld’s article on vesting if you need a primer.
Vesting is a good idea:
You are critical to the company and you have told your investors that you are committed to the business. They are simply asking you to put your shares where your mouth is: a vesting schedule demonstrates your commitment to the company.
Vesting also ensures that a co-founder who leaves the company early doesn’t receive the same amount of equity as co-founders who stay in the business.

Get vested for time served building the business.
But don’t agree to vest all of your shares just because it is supposedly “standard”.

If you have been working on the company full-time for one year, 25% of your shares should be vested up-front and the balance of your shares should vest over three to four years. The best vesting agreement we have seen for a founder in a Series A is 25% of shares vested up-front with the balance vesting over three years.
You should argue that,
“New employees who join the company today will earn all their shares over four years. Employees who are already here should be credited for their time served.”

We don’t recommend trying to escape a four-year commitment to the company (including time served). Four years is the typical commitment for a start up, high school, or college, as well as the span between Olympics and World Cups, and the term we give our Presidents to start as many wars as possible.
Consider cliffs for newfound co-founders.
One-year cliffs are typical for employees but are currently rare for founders.
Nevertheless, consider negotiating one-year cliffs with newfound co-founders whom you haven’t worked with in the past. If a co-founder leaves the company after three months, you don’t want him walking out the door with a large chunk of the company.

"# Getting Leverage in Hostage Negotiations

“Every time the other party says ‘I want’ in a negotiation, you should hear the pleasant sound of a weight dropping on your side of the leverage scales.”

– G. Richard Shell, Bargaining for Advantage

Most entrepreneurs don’t understand the power of positive leverage. Here’s a typical situation:

After weeks of fund-raising, you find a brave investor who says “Yes, I want to invest.” He says he will give you an offer soon. You’re excited. A few days later he delivers a term sheet that you don’t like. The valuation is really low. Or the non-economic terms aren’t favorable. Your excitement turns to disappointment and frustration. This is the only offer you have so far. What do you do?

First, we hope you’ve been talking to several investors at the same time and creating a market for your shares. With an adroit touch, you can use this first offer to create the scarcity and social proof that drives other investors to say “yes”. At a minimum, you can use this offer to drive investors to make any decision at all — up or down. And keep improving your alternatives until you’ve a signed term sheet.

But let’s assume you don’t have any other offers and you have to negotiate with this investor. Or that this investor is your first choice — whether or not you have alternatives.

This type of negotiation is similar to a hostage negotiation because you can’t walk away from your opponent. You can’t say, “Yeah, it’s okay, go ahead and kill the hostages, we’re not interested in your demands.”

When you have to negotiate without good alternatives, the tools of positive, negative, and normative leverage are essential. Positive leverage is your ability to provide things that your opponent wants. You have positive leverage when your opponent says, “I want to buy your car”, “I want you to release my friends from jail” or “I want to buy your shares”.

As soon as your opponent says he wants something from you, you have some positive leverage. You control what they want. You can grant them access or deny it. That’s why experienced opponents delay making offers — they don’t want to give you leverage.

How does positive leverage work in practice?

First, positive leverage should improve your psychology during the negotiation. You’ve gone from a situation where you want something from the investor to a situation where you both want something from each other. Your psychology is critical in a negotiation because “leverage often flows to the party that exerts the greatest control over and appears most comfortable with the present situation.”

Second, you can now identify other things that your opponent wants and deliver them. Maybe you’re working with a partner who is trying to get his first deal done at the firm. Help him succeed and help yourself in the process. Maybe you’re working with a firm who is excited about stealing a deal from a top-tier firm. Help them succeed. Maybe you’re working with a firm who wants to co-invest with a top-tier firm so they can show off to their LPs. Help them succeed.

Third, even before investors makes an offer, you gain a little bit of leverage every time they ask for something. Don’t try to use it after the first meeting. But if you’ve been talking to them for three weeks and they’re getting deeper and deeper into diligence, you should recognize and use your leverage. At a minimum, you should ask for information about their process and thinking at every step of the way.

The prime time to negotiate is when your opponent says, “I want.”

“If they’re talking to you, you have leverage.”

"# HalfAssed Startup Start your company and keep your day job

“I kept my day job for over six years while working mornings, nights, and weekends to create Dilbert.”

– Scott Adams

[Ed: I enjoyed Tony Wright‘s contrarian article, Half-Assed Startup, when I first read it on his excellent blog. Tony, a founder of RescueTime (Y Combinator), argues that you can start a company while you’re otherwise employed. And he explains how to do it. Tony kindly agreed to re-publish his article on Venture Hacks. Take it away Tony.]

I’ve done two part-time-to-full-time startups. One was acquired by Jobster. The second startup is RescueTime—currently a Y Combinator funded company—cross your fingers.

In the long run, I think Paul Graham has it right in How Not to Die—you can’t half-ass a startup:

“The number one thing not to do is other things. If you find yourself saying a sentence that ends with “but we’re going to keep working on the startup,” you are in big trouble. Bob’s going to grad school, but we’re going to keep working on the startup. We’re moving back to Minnesota, but we’re going to keep working on the startup. We’re taking on some consulting projects, but we’re going to keep working on the startup. You may as well just translate these to “we’re giving up on the startup, but we’re not willing to admit that to ourselves,” because that’s what it means most of the time. A startup is so hard that working on it can’t be preceded by “but.””

In the beginning, however, it’s not always practical to dive in full-time.  And when your idea is off-the-wall and easy to prototype, it’s smart to whip something out just to see if it’s as cool as you think it might be—before you take the full-time plunge.

So if you’re too poor or too unsure to do the right thing for your business and dive in full-time, here are a few things that seemed to work for us when we did it part-time:

In short, you want to prove whatever you need to prove as quickly as possible, so you can dive in full-time.  Near as I can tell, there are plenty of startups that have started as “hobbies”, but you need to take it out of that phase as soon as you can.  There is nothing that drives a team forward like the fear of public failure, debt, and starvation.  Leap off the cliff and start building the airplane on the way down—you might be surprised with what you can pull off.

"# How common is accelerated vesting on change in control

How common is accelerated vesting on change in control (AVCoC)?   Noam Wasserman from HBS has the answer in Unlocking Your Golden Handcuffs:

“I recently got an email from a serial entrepreneur who has been brought on as the head of finance and operations in a mobile-services start-up. One of his questions was: How often do new-venture executives get AVCoC? If it’s not common for them to get it, he wouldn’t push for it and would focus his negotiating leverage on another term, but if it’s common, he wanted to push hard for it. (He felt that the start-up might be the subject of M&A activity in the future, and had already experienced working for a large company after a prior venture of his had been acquired.)…

“Overall, the percentage of executives receiving AVCoC was 65.5%.  However, as shown in the chart below, the percentage varied from a high of 76.4% for CEOs down to 46.3% for the Head of Human Resources.  (I only show the positions for which I had at least 100 data points.)…



“I also analyzed AVCoC at the team level, which is the focus of your first (“side note”) point.  At the team level, 36% of the teams (429 ventures) had a “mixed” approach to AVCoC, wherein some executives had AVCoC and some did not. In those ventures, executives would seem to have been negotiating AVCoC on a case-by-case basis, in the absence of a consistent plan adopted across the team/venture. Of the other ventures, 47% (561 ventures) had AVCoC across all of the executives in the survey. Those 47% might include some ventures that adopted a consistent plan and others where the AVCoC’s were put in place on a case-by-case basis. Finally, 17% did not have a single executive with AVCoC (yet?).”

There is also a great discussion of AVCoC in the comments to Noam’s post.

"# How do I find a lead investor Part 1

“Those kind of ‘sit on the sideline’ investors are worthless to you if you want to get a financing done… if you are raising a financing of any kind, spend all of your time looking for a lead investor.”

— Fred Wilson, Union Square Ventures

Summary: Financings happen when you find a lead investor, negotiate a term sheet, and if there’s room, politely tell followers that they can take it or leave it. Alternatively, if you have a group of seed investors who aren’t asking you to find a lead, you can mass syndicate the round without a lead. Finally, ‘find a lead’ often means ‘no’.

So Bill the Cat writes in:

“We’re out on the warpath, with the aim of raising a Series A round in the $1M range. We’ve had a number of people say they are interested in participating, but nobody wants to lead because they know little/nothing about our market. Is there anything we can do about that, other than just keep searching for a lead? I’m pretty confident that at this point if we found one, we’d be set.”

From Fred Wilson‘s The “Lead Investor”:

“I got an email from a friend yesterday who… said that he’s got indications of interest from a number of investors but they are all waiting for a “lead investor”.

“I told him that what he has is a bunch of followers who have no real conviction about his business because if they did, they’d step up, negotiate a deal, and get their money into his company. But instead they are going to sit on the sidelines, wait until someone with conviction shows up, and then try to get in alongside the investor with conviction.

“Those kind of “sit on the sideline” investors are worthless to you if you want to get a financing done. They don’t impress the kind of investors who have conviction because investors with conviction are going to want all of the deal for themselves (or their friends they will bring in alongside of them).

“If you are raising a financing of any kind, spend all of your time looking for a lead investor.”

Lead investors want at least half the round—and they often want the entire thing. If they don’t want the entire round, they will help you find followers (and some leads will even close before you find followers). They believe your stock is worth more than they’re paying. They don’t need social proof or scarcity to make an investment decision. Like great entrepreneurs, they are mavericks.

Financings happen when you find a lead, negotiate a term sheet, and if there’s room, politely tell followers that they can take it or leave it.

Lead investors who bet on unproven markets, products, or teams (or all of the above) are rare. If you’re unproven, don’t be surprised if fund-raising takes time.

“Investors saying that they are waiting for a lead are also saying ‘no’ without saying no… They don’t want to miss out if this thing takes off (e.g., “Hey, we told you we were in, I hope you saved 10 percent for us!”), but they have no conviction and don’t want to say no in case they’re wrong.”

— Dick Costolo, Founder of FeedBurner

Instead of saying “no”, an investor might ask you to “find a lead”. Why? He wants to maintain an option to invest. If you find a great lead or the company starts kicking ass, the follower will say he intended to invest all along.

By telling you to find a lead, the follower is trying to extract a subtle commitment from you and manipulate your psychological desire to follow through on your commitments. Negotiators call this a consistency trap. We’ll show you how to avoid this trap in Part 2.

Professional investors (VCs) have two legitimate reasons to not lead: #

In either case, the follower should partner with you to find a lead. His level of effort will tell you if he really wants to find a lead or he just doesn’t want to say ‘no’.

Small seed funds that are investing their personal money and non-professional investors like angels may have other good reasons to not lead: they don’t want to deal with negotiating terms and hiring a lawyer, their portion of the financing is too small to lead, they like you but they don’t know the market, et cetera. #

If this is the case, you might not need a lead. If you have a group of seed investors who are not explicitly asking you to find a lead, you should:

In Part 2, we’ll suggest some ways to find a lead if you can’t mass syndicate the round.

"# How do I find a lead investor Part 2

Summary: Here are 3 microhacks for finding a lead investor: (1) If followers have good reasons to not lead, ask them for introductions to potential leads. (2) If you’re early stage, find seed investors who invest in people and high risk startups. (3) If every prospective investor says “we don’t know the market,” find investors who have invested in your market or similar markets.

In Part 1, we wrote,

“Lead investors want at least half the round—and they often want the entire thing. If they don’t want the entire round, they will help you find followers (and some leads will close immediately even if they’re not taking the entire round). They believe your stock is worth more than they’re paying. They don’t need social proof or scarcity to make an investment decision. Like great entrepreneurs, they are mavericks.”

If you’re doing a seed round, you may be able to mass syndicate the financing without a lead. Otherwise, here are three microhacks for finding a lead, in rough order of importance—but you should probably try them all.

If the followers have good reasons to not lead, ask them for introductions to potential leads:

“Can you suggest any firms who would be interested in leading this investment? Why do you think they would be interested in leading? Would you make an introduction?”

This simple test will tell you whether the follower has good reasons to not lead. If a follower won’t make introductions, he doesn’t have a good reason to not lead. If the introduction doesn’t respond aggressively, the follower probably made a half-hearted introduction—he doesn’t have a good reason to not lead. The follower’s level of effort indicates if he really wants to find a lead or he just doesn’t want to say ‘no’. (Caveat: This logic mostly applies to VCs, not angels.)

If a follower doesn’t have a good reason a priori, don’t ask him for introductions at all. Skip this microhack altogether. An introduction by someone who can and should lead, but would rather follow, is a useless and harmful introduction. It’s a strong negative signal. Go get your own introductions.



Finally, if a follower introduces you to the eventual leader, the leader will rarely cut out the follower. (Investors who don’t accommodate the middleman who gives them introductions stop getting introductions.) You’ll end up with two investors and more dilution. But that’s better than the alternative: zero investors and no dilution.

Every professional investor’s fantasy investment is a sure thing: zero risk and infinite reward. If you’re early stage, you can circumvent this fun fact by doing a seed round:

“What seed stage companies have you backed in the last 2 years? What exactly did the company (team, product, traction) look like when you invested?”

Does your company look similar?

Seed investors increase the probability of raising money from VCs. High-quality seed investors raise your valuation, provide social proof, and obviate the need for extensive due diligence in the VC round. Many companies close a small seed round and do a larger VC round in a few months.

If you want to skip the seed round, mere commitments from high-quality seed investors have a similar effect. And these commitments provide a strong alternative as you negotiate with VCs. Obviously, if you do the VC round, don’t cut out any seed investors you have committed to.

If every prospective investor says “we don’t know your market,” find investors who have backed companies in your market or similar markets.

Educate investors about your market. It’s your job to convince them the market is great. Find successful companies in your market and figure out how they got there, how long it took them to get there, how much money they raised, how much money they’re making, how much money they would be making if they were as smart as you are, et cetera.

Talk to the management at these companies and see if they will personally invest in your business or advise you. Ask if their company wants to be a strategic investor.

"# How do I find a lead investor Part 3

Summary: Here are 2 more microhacks for finding a lead investor: (4) Incent followers to lead by telling them the truth: there probably won’t be room in the round for followers. (5) The best way to find a lead is to build something that attracts a lead: keep building your company and reducing risk.

In parts 1 and 2, we presented three microhacks for finding a lead investor. Here are two more microhacks, in continuing order of importance.

Whenever someone says “find a lead”, you should say,

“We’re happy you’re interested. We’re interested in working with you too.

“We’re looking for a lead and a lead is going to want the entire round. Or he will bring in his own co-investors. Or we’ll build a syndicate out of investors who want to lead. So we may be back but we probably won’t.

“Most likely, the investors who get to participate in this round are those who want to lead. If you’re interested, you can secure a spot in the round by leading and we’ll work with you to set the terms and decide who gets to invest.”

Note: Make an exception for (1) angels you are trying to mass syndicate and (2) investors who have good reasons to follow and are partnering with you to find a lead.

This polite diatribe combines positive leverage (“you can secure a spot in the round by leading and we’ll work with you to set the terms and decide who gets to invest”) and negative leverage (“the only people who get to participate in this round are those who want to lead”, i.e. you may lose the option to invest if you don’t act now.) Their reaction to this message will tell you whether they have good reasons to follow or they just don’t want to say no.

If you have existing seed investors, you can also use them as the bad cop:

“We really like you but my existing investors are pushing me to find a lead and not spend time building a syndicate. Are you willing to lead the round?”

“If you’ve got a good idea, market, and team, raising money won’t be your problem.”

— Sam Altman, Founder of Loopt

“Nobody said this would be easy.”

— Marc Andreessen

Your company may not be good enough to raise money. So how do you get good enough? Read Marc Andreessen’s When the VCs say “no”:

“If you’re an investor, you look at the risk around an investment as if it’s an onion. Just like you peel an onion and remove each layer in turn, risk in a startup investment comes in layers that get peeled away—reduced—one by one.

Your challenge as an entrepreneur trying to raise venture capital is to keep peeling layers of risk off of your particular onion until the VCs say “yes”—until the risk in your startup is reduced to the point where investing in your startup doesn’t look terrifying and merely looks risky.”

Marc’s goes on to describe the various layers of risk and, even better, he tells you how to peel the layers away. This is the most useful article on improving the effectiveness of startups that we have ever seen—read it.



Founder risk is the number one reason startups don’t get funded: the team simply does not appear up to the task. If you have a good product in a good market and you can’t figure out why you keep getting rejected, look in the mirror and remove/add people until the team inspires money to fly out of investor’s pockets.

This is the fifth microhack but it should really be the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth. The best way to find a lead is to build something that attracts a lead.

“No one ever got anywhere by lavishing calls on Oprah. The only time I’ve succeeded in my career with Oprah was [when] Oprah called us.”

"# How do we set the valuation for a seed round

A reader asks:

“My question is how do we value a company with no sales? I understand it’s an arbitrary valuation but is there anything we can possibly base it on? Is there a “default” valuation for companies in a seed round?”

We’ll answer this question with some questions (and answers) of our own:

First, figure out how much money you need to run at least two experiments*. Then tack on 3 more months of runway so you can raise another round before you run out of money. This is the minimum amount of money you should raise. For example, let’s say you need $100K.

* Your experiments should be constructed such that a positive result will let you raise more money at a higher valuation.

Now decide what percentage of the company you will sell for $100K. Pick a number between 10% and 20% of the company’s post-money. You can go below 10% but that probably means your valuation will be too high or you will raise too little money.

For example, let’s say you’re willing to sell up to 15% of the company—that’s your bottom line dilution. This implies a bottom line post-money valuation of $666K.

Finally, tell investors that,

“First, we think we can make the company significantly more valuable if we raise $100K—that’s our minimum. Second, we’re willing to sell up to 10% of the company.”

10% is your aspirational dilution. It’s the lowest dilution you can justify. It’s the lowest dilution you can say with a straight face.

Notice that you didn’t explicitly state your valuation. Combining the dilution (10%) with the minimum amount you’re raising ($100K) implies a minimum post-money valuation of $1M. But the valuation is not explicit. This gives you room to raise your valuation if you raise more than $100K (and we suggest you raise as much money as possible).

If $25K buys 1% of company, your post-money is $2.5M—that’s on the high end.

If $25K buys 5% of company, your post-money is $0.5M—that’s on the low end.

Y Combinator has set new lows for seed round valuations. They get away with it because they also set new highs for helping seed stage companies.

According to the YC FAQ, they buy about 6% of a company for $15K-$20K. So the post-money valuation of their investments is $250K-$333K.

But don’t fixate on valuation. Low valuations aren’t bad if you keep the dilution down too. 6% dilution is very low if the company makes a lot of progress with $15K-$20K.

If you sell 20% of your company at a $2.5M post-money, you raise $500K. That’s about the maximum for a seed round. Beyond that is Series A country.

Take as much money as you can while keeping dilution between 15-30% (10%-20% of the dilution goes to investors and 5%-10% goes to the option pool).

Compare this to a Series A which might have 30%-55% dilution. (20%-40% of the dilution goes to investors and 10%-15% goes to the option pool.)

A seed round can pay for itself if the quality of your investors and progress brings your eventual Series A dilution down from 55% to 30% (for the same amount of Series A cash).

Don’t over-optimize your dilution. Raising money is often harder than you expect, especially for first-time entrepreneurs.

Smart investors don’t over-optimize dilution either. They want to buy enough points to own a good chunk of the company. But they want to leave the founders with enough points to keep them highly motivated to build a lot of value for the founders and investors alike.

"# How to bring a product to market  A very rare interview with Sean Ellis

Sean Ellis recently sat down with us and explained how to bring products to market. You should listen to this interview for ideas on how to get to product/market fit, how to measure fit, and how to survey your users so you can improve fit.

If you don’t know Sean from his blog or tweets, he lead marketing from launch to IPO filing at LogMeIn and Uproar. His firm, 12in6, then worked with Xobni (Khosla), Dropbox (Sequoia), Eventbrite (Sequoia), Grockit (Benchmark)…  the list goes on. 12in6 “helps startups unlock their full growth potential by focusing on the core value perceived by their most passionate users.”

This is the first time Sean has done an interview on the record. I’m really psyched he’s making his insights public — this interview is a must-listen. We’ve broken the interview into two parts: 1) before fit and 2) after fit. This post contains Part 1 (and here’s Part 2.)

Nivi: Hi, this is Nivi from Venture Hacks, and I’m here with Sean Ellis. We’re going to talk about how to bring a startup’s product to market.

This interview is broken up into two parts: before product/market fit and after product/market fit. Or to put it another way, what are the set of activities you have to do to get the product/market fit, and then once you’re there, what are the set of activities you have to do to prepare for sustainable growth.

I’m super psyched about this interview. This is Sean’s first-ever interview on the record. We’re going to jump right into it.

Sean Ellis: The whole idea that’s gotten me to where I am right now, where I’m doing multiple companies, is basically that I’m just trying to get lots of cycles, up front, in that really critical zone — I  call it the fail zone — that if you don’t get that done right, the company will fail. And if you figure that part out, then it’s really a question of how much success is the business going to have?

Particularly, one of the things that I’ve learned that’s been a little humbling through the experience is that if nobody wants the product, it doesn’t matter how effective the marketer is, you’re going to have a really hard time being successful. And if people want the product, you don’t have to be that great a marketer — the product is just so much easier to market. So half the battle, I’ve realized over time, is just finding the right company with a product that people actually need, and that there’s a big enough market that can support growth for that business.

Nivi: Yeah, and what might be interesting for some people to hear is what’s in that grey zone between nobody wants the product, to a lot of people consider the product to be a must-have. For example, sites that have great marketing and distribution through viral marketing, but they don’t necessarily have any real must-have-it-ness with their customers or with their users.

Sean: All right, so the question really being: the grey-zone products that fall between those must-have products, and products that maybe aren’t as strong of a must-have, but can you be successful with those?

I am just figuring this out as I go along. I know that there is no right answer on any of these things. What I do know is that if you have a must-have product, your chances of success are very high.

And the way that I figure out if a product is a must-have or not is: what percentage of people are telling me that they’d be very disappointed if they could no longer use it? But it seems like you find a lot of categories where you might say that it’s a nice-to-have, rather than a must-have.

And I think that the difference is that for a nice-to-have product — so, something where not a lot of people say they’d be very disappointed without it — that you probably can be successful, but it’s going to take a lot of effort on the marketing side to make up for those product deficiencies.

I think if you really step back and say, as a business, that ultimately our goal is to create a successful, fast growing business, that people really need our product, and that over time we have a defensible business where it’s really hard for somebody to come in and provide an alternative product where we start losing customers, that in an early stage startup you have an opportunity to put a product out there, get that initial user feedback, and then you have two choices.

If that feedback is really strong and the users say that they’d be very disappointed without it, in a large percentage, then you can try to grow the business.

Alternatively, if they come back and say that they wouldn’t be that disappointed without the product, then you have the choices where you can either try to grow it or you can decide that you’re not going to try and grow the business. And to me, my recommendation has always been to decide not to grow the business if it doesn’t have a lot of people that are real passionate about the solutions.

Actually, you can operate a startup at a pretty low cost if you basically have a small engineering team and you’re putting product out there and you’re not spending a lot to get people on there, but you’re really engaging the people that do come in. You can engage them much better if there aren’t that many people, so you’re in a position where it may take you a year or two years, but you can really, over time, start to evolve a product into being something that someone wants.

Maybe you find early on that absolutely nobody wants the product, and in that case you might want to do a complete restart on the business.

And when I’m presenting to groups, the example that I always point to, mostly so that people know that there’s hope if they don’t have great product/market fit initially….

Sean: That product/market fit is how I describe having a large percentage of people that would be very disappointed without the product. If you’re above 40% of the people saying they’d be very disappointed, I tend to say you’ve found product/market fit, and if you’re less than that, you haven’t.

So a lot of times I meet with companies that are maybe in the 15% to 20% range on that, and it’s very discouraging. You’ve worked very hard to put out a product, so the example that I give them is PayPal, where the initial product that they came out with was a cryptography product where you would use a PDA to store access codes for servers, and it was better than carrying a bunch of individual devices to access those servers. And the problem they were solving was that there was a lot of clutter in carrying those devices, and they were going to consolidate them all onto a single hand-held.

In “Founders at Work” there is a great case study on this. What Max Levchin says in “Founders at Work” is that they put the product out there and “nobody really needed it.” That was a direct quote — “nobody really needed it.” So what they decided…. Most companies would try to interpret the data and keep blasting away and say that somebody needs it. They just don’t get it yet.

Nivi: We need more distribution….

Sean: Yeah, they blame marketing, they blame sales, but ultimately, it took a lot of guts, and just honesty, to say: You know what? We created something that nobody really needs.

So what they did at that point was they stepped back. They asked what are we good at? We’re good at developing for a handheld PDA. We’re good at security. What else can we do with these skill assets that we have? And they decided that they were going to get into the mobile PDA payment space, where basically, people could beam payments back and forth.

And on the initial vision they were able to raise a couple hundred thousand dollars. On this new vision, they were able to get a prototype out on that initial money that they had raised, and they were able to raise… I think it was four million dollars. I don’t remember the exact number on it. And they actually beamed the VC money over so they had a good enough prototype to be able to accept the payment via this PDA payment. And then they were off to the races, and they started executing the business.

I think, in that case, my guess is that if they had surveyed those users who were using PDAs to make payments; it was more of a party trick. It was something that there wasn’t a real big need for, but they got users on there. They got lots of users on there, and they were able to get those users coming back. But, I’d put it in that probably-nice-to-have category.

Nice-to-have is kind of a scary thing, because you get enough success that you want to keep at it. But they were very fortunate in that they sort of stumbled into what ultimately became their market, which was, of course, the web-payment platform that PayPal is today. And that was really a function of people just starting to use it that way. And so, that’s why I focus a lot with companies on helping them figure out the use cases behind their product. If the people who have one use case consider it much more of a must-have than people who have a different use case, then that’s probably the business you’re going to be able to build a successful business on.

Nivi: So, do you ask the must-have users what they use the product for?

Sean: I ask everybody what they use the product for, and I’m trying to see, really, who has the most passion around the product. And usually it breaks down by use cases, sometimes by user types. It’s really just looking through the initial data to really understand who really needs this product, and it can be on demographics, it can be on use cases, it can be on a lot of different things. But once you really understand a group that really needs the product, then you start to have that true North for the business — the part that you can actually start to build a business that will grow and thrive around if they represent a big enough market.

Nivi: Right. In that product/market fit stage that you’re talking about, which is basically the bottom layer of your pyramid, what don’t you do? For example: PR, trying to get a lot of distribution, increasing your burn.

Sean: Well, it depends a little bit on the type of business that you have.

So just one quick thing on wrapping up the PayPal example was, by the time they pulled the plug on their mobile-payment business they actually had, I think it was 1,000 times more people using the web payments. They had obvious traction, so they didn’t need to necessarily get that from a survey. They could just see that they had the traction there at that point. They could say: You know what? That’s where our real business is. Even though they fought it, initially, because they had different preconceptions about where their business would be.

Sean: I purposely try to avoid working with companies that are pre-product/market fit, because they’re in such a risk zone that, one, it’s going to hurt my reputation if I string too many of those together, and two, to ask people, who have a product that people don’t need, to pay me to help them with marketing would just not be the right thing to do. It would be a mistake for them to pay me, and it’s just not smart, from my perspective, to stake my reputation on their success.

But I found myself working with one fairly recently, on a very short, almost advisory project, of just helping them out. And my advice to them was to really be laser focused on that number and to really monitor that very-disappointed number.

So, one of the things that I’ve seen work well for companies that are in the 20% range, or even lower, of the user saying they’d be very disappointed without it, is to focus on, one, why those people would be very disappointed without it, and to really start to say, OK, this is our best signal of value that we’re creating.

And then, to look at the feedback from the people who would only be somewhat disappointed without it. Ignore the people who say they would not be disappointed without it, because they’re so far from being satisfied.

But then look at those somewhat disappointed people, and look at feedback from those people — particularly on what changes they’d like to see in the product. And look for things that relate to the very-disappointed feedback. If you take all feedback equally, you’re going to have a very broad product experience that is very disjointed.

And I think one of the mistakes when people are too responsive to user feedback is that it’s a product that does everything, because if you try to please everybody, you’re essentially going to have a very unfocused product. But if you use the feedback from your very-disappointed people to give you that focus, and now you’re looking for feedback from everyone else that relates to what the very-disappointed people have told you…

Nivi: Like with PayPal, for example.

Sean: I think, using PayPal as an example, if they had surveyed all of their users, I’m assuming that a lot of the people who were doing the hand-held payments would basically have been saying that they’re only somewhat disappointed without it. And then the people who were doing the web payments would be saying that they’d be very disappointed without it. But some of the people on the web payments would be saying somewhat-disappointed, and they would say: if only I felt more comfortable about security; or, if only I could do it faster; or, if only you could give me better records of payments that have been made.

So you could take the feedback from the somewhat-disappointed who were using hand-held payments, and act on that to try to get there, but then you’re not really honing in on where the passion is.

Or, you could take it from the other side, saying, OK, these people may be a little pickier about what defines something that’s a must-have, but the feedback that they’re giving would improve the experience for the people who already say it’s a must-have. So, it’s really trying to just hone a consistent, core-product vision that is already starting to crystallize based on the feedback from the really passionate users.

Nivi: Yeah, that’s great. So in this case, it’s related in the sense that somewhat-disappointed people are using the same segment of features in PayPal.

Sean: Yeah. It’s that use case.

Nivi: Use case.

Sean: Yeah. They’re suggesting improvements to the use case that’s consistent with the most gratified users there are.

Nivi: Great! Yeah. So that’s a great idea in terms of getting what you need to do to get product/market fit, and I’d like to talk more about that, but it would also be great to hear what you don’t do.

Sean: I think the thing that you don’t do — and I’ll make one caveat in a second, on this — is that you don’t aggressively try to grow the business. Particularly, you’re not trying to do business development relationships. Maybe you can spend enough to create some flow so you actually get people giving you the feedback on the product, but one thing I wouldn’t do is obsess over ROI on that flow. 

Your goal is not to figure out that repeatable, scalable customer acquisition engine at that point. Your goal is to get enough people in there to where you can react to their feedback and hone the product experience on their feedback.

Nivi: How about a launch?

Sean: This is very debatable. A lot of people would say that a launch is a really important event. For me, I’ve never been big into launches. Launch is a one-off. With launch, you’re going to get a group of people in one time, and you’re going to get some feedback on them. And yes, they may be cheaper because you got some good press around it, but you haven’t learned anything about how to grow the business with a launch. So for me, I’m much more….

I wrote a blog post way back when. I think it was called “Launch with a Trickle,” and that’s much more of my focus on things. Just get enough people on there as early as you can, so that you can react to their feedback. And you may find that they absolutely love the product. Then hone in on why they love the product. And then get the messaging right and the experience right, so that you’re delivering that better. Once you’ve kind of tightened up and you’ve got that validation that a lot of people love your product — hopefully more than 40% say they’d be very disappointed without it — then you can step on the accelerator and a big launch might make sense at that point.

Sean: But what I see too many companies do is set a date. They say, we’re going to have our launch on January 14th, and they’re two months away from that and they’re working towards… I mean, it’s either time or it’s not time.

Nivi: Yeah, and you can’t set a deadline on product/market fit. Right? That is the point in time, in the growth of a company, where you basically are unable to predict anything.

Sean: Right. And all you’re going to do then is make the mistake of being too aggressive too early, or piss off your investors by missing that date for the launch.

So it’s much better to say, our clear objective — the next milestone that we need to get to before we do all of these things — is to actually make sure that enough people love this product. As soon as we get there, then we have to figure out why, and make sure that we’re really honing every piece of the business to reflect why people love the product.

Nivi: Right. So, on that topic, how do you communicate with the board and set expectations when you’re trying to get to the product/market fit stage?

Sean: What I’ve found is that people either get it or they don’t.

Nivi: What are the responses of the people that don’t get it, like from a board perspective? What have you heard board members say directly, or secondhand?

Sean: They’re just: You’ve got to go for it! You’ve got to go for it! It’s good enough. It’s good enough. And they just want to accelerate the business.

I have a great example of a company that was about 15% or 20% on product/market fit and I loosely advised them at no cost, because I was going to spend some time in Scotland and they’re based in Scotland. And I wanted to get to know these guys better because I was going to be spending a week over there. So we just worked together over a period of time.

And when we first started working together they were at the 15% or 20% very-disappointed number, and they explained to me that their board of directors was just pushing them on: We’ve got to get to this growth number! We’ve got to get to this growth number!

And they took the time to really explain: This is our goal right now. We don’t think our product is good enough to accelerate this business. Our goal is to take the feedback from the users that we have and keep getting our product better.

In the process of doing that, they had the very painful process of actually having to lower projections on growth, and doing it week after week, and frustrating their board of directors through that process. But they did exactly the right thing, because today their very-disappointed number is over 50%.

And when I met with them when I was in Scotland about a month-and-a-half ago, they were at a really exciting point where they said they keep going back to their board of directors and saying: Hey! We’re going to revise those numbers up. They kept going and saying the numbers are too low. It’s going to be better than that, because now that they have the product right they could really focus on that, and they weren’t going to have the….

You can grow when your product/market fit is lower than that, but you’re going to grow a lot slower than you otherwise would, and you’re not going to address the real problem. And you’re going to have a very frustrating experience trying to grow that business over the next several years, versus saying: Let’s keep our costs really low, let’s get the product right, and when we’re focused on growth, no excuses. Now we’re absolutely accelerating that business and it’s going to be much easier to grow the business at that point.

And ultimately, you take it a year out or two years out, you’re going to have a much bigger userbase doing it that way than if you’re trying to grow through the whole period of time.

Nivi: Now, what changes should they make to get to that number, without getting into the specifics of the business?

Sean: I don’t know. I didn’t work with them, so all I know is that they did the things that I’ve mentioned, where they really took the feedback of the very-disappointed people, really tried to look for the signal of who loves this product. Somebody loves it. Who loves it? Why do they love it? How can we really put a stake in the ground around that and try to make that piece better, and try to play down the other pieces?

Nivi: Then maybe reposition?

Sean: Yes. Some of it’s definitely through repositioning.

I have another company that I worked with that was before I had [done] that. This was really the company that helped me come up with the idea that I was going to survey people ahead of time, because I got into two companies at the exact same time who were both at about [where] 7% of their users said they’d be very disappointed, and found myself in the “oh, crap!” moment of figuring out that now I’m going to have to help these guys transition to growth and grow, but they’re not ready for it yet. And why did I wait until I had a six-month contract with them to run the survey? From now on I’m going to survey it ahead of time.

But at one of those two companies, we were able to see a really strong signal in the 7% that said they’d be very disappointed without it, reposition on that signal… [interrupted]

Nivi: So how do you reposition on the signal. In this case, did you get a little bit more data…?

Sean: We just found out — I mean, I can’t give any specifics on it — they had a product that had lots of different features, and each one of those products could be a product in itself. They built a really big suite of tools, within a product, and everyone who said they’d be very disappointed was focused on just one of those. So we basically only talked about the one they were focused on, and we didn’t talk about any of the other things.

Nivi: To the user, say, on a landing page or on the home page.

Sean: Exactly — on the home page we only highlighted that and said we’ll introduce the other stuff after we get them in. One of the benefits with that was that we were really able to simplify messaging. Having a really complex product set that you have to present people is way harder than simplifying that and only highlighting one. So, we basically highlighted the most important must-have product from the group, and hid some of the other products, and as a result we could be much clearer in what the benefit was for the people coming through and what we were actually offering.

So, one week later, on the next cohort of people coming through, we were over 40% because they had a very different expectation of what this product was, just by changing the messaging and focusing their first user experience on just this one piece of the business.

Nivi: Right. So, with no real change in the product, but a change in the messaging and a little bit of first-user experience change, you got a huge uptick in the must-haves.

Sean: Yup, exactly. And the interesting thing is that business, probably out of every business that I’ve worked with, is the one that I think has the opportunity to be a multi-billion dollar business, and one that I’m most excited about. And when I first saw that 7% number, it was the one that I thought: how do I get out of this? So now I’m really happy that I stuck with it, and I’m happy that we were able to figure those things out. And I’m really good friends with the founders.

Sean: When everything’s going well, the chemistry gets much stronger and it’s just a much more enjoyable place to be. That’s just one of the things that I’ve learned, is that in a company with a low product/market fit, it’s not a fun place to be. It’s frustrating trying to grow that business.

And for a company that can really embrace the fact that: You know what? We missed. The product that we created just isn’t something that people really seem to want or need.

Nivi: And we don’t really measure ourselves through growth right now, either.

Sean: Yeah. So for us, we’ve got a lot of money in the bank. Somehow we got lucky enough to raise the venture capital. If we try to grow we’re going to waste a lot of that money trying to grow. Let’s just keep our costs way down, get just enough users in there and either do a complete reset on the business — like PayPal did, which I think most companies don’t need to do — or just find the love.

In my last blog post I talk about “just find the love.” Somebody loves it. Somebody really needs that, and once you find that, that’s the stake in the ground that you can figure out how to create a successful business.

Nivi: And what is just enough users?

Sean: That’s a good question. I think it kind of depends on the business, but ideally, if you have a product that ultimately is going to cost thousands of dollars, then it’s just not going to be realistic that you can bring in a hundred every day on that product. But if you have a product that’s going to have a 10% upgrade rate or a 10% purchase rate, and it’s going to be $100, then that’s a product that you probably want to try to have a pretty constant flow of around 100 new people a day.

And whatever it costs to get to that 100 new people a day is a really good flow to iterate on. If you can only be at 30 or 40, that’s probably OK.

Nivi: And how about on the output side of that — the people that you’re going to survey, the people that have gotten to the finish line? How many people do you need to be talking to, to get a good signal there?

Sean: I look for around 30 responses as a minimum. It really depends. If you have a very low percentage of users that say they’d be very disappointed… Say you’ve got 30 responses and you’ve only got 5% that say they’d be very disappointed without it, that’s not a whole lot to work with on finding a signal.

But I ran a survey this morning with a business that has 70% of their users that say they’d be very disappointed. We got a very strong signal on 42 responses.

Nivi: OK. Right.

Sean: Really, it kind of depends, first, on how strong that number is. And then what you’re trying to do is get enough responses in there to find some sort of signal that either says: We completely missed, or that [there are] very few people we’ve hit with, so we want to make sure that we survey enough people that we’ve got maybe 10 or 20 people who say they’d be very disappointed, that we can start to hone in on the feedback that they’re giving.

Nivi: And do you ever have trouble defining what that finish line should be? For example: active monthly users, people who just signed up for the product, or is it… [interrupted]

Sean: Do you mean on who to survey?

Nivi: Yeah.

Sean: What I tend to do is say, people who have been back at least once.

And I think for a consumer product you shouldn’t be charging at this point; it should be free at this point, because the money side already starts to put a big filter out there. Even if you had a trial, people would make up their mind pretty quickly. If they decide they’re not going to buy it, then they’re not going to say they’d be very disappointed without it, and not buy it. So, just pulling money off until you can get that signal is pretty important.

For me, I define what is actually the experience that we think is the experience that gives them a full taste for the product, then I want to make sure that people have at least done that when they come back to us.

Nivi: So in the case of PayPal what would that be?

Sean: That they’ve at least made a payment with PayPal or accepted a payment.

Nivi: One payment?

Sean: Yeah. And then, that they’ve been on the site within the last two weeks.

Nivi: OK.

Sean: So those would be kind of the two pieces. You just asked about intent and the value proposition in some of those things, so I think the important starting point is that the promise or the differentiated value proposition is really based on whatever signal that you find. Where you find the love on the product, that’s what you’re trying to do there.

Nivi: And you call that promise.

Sean: Promise is one of the names I use for it, but it’s all synonymous with just the value proposition, the differentiated value proposition of just what is this product going to do for you. What is the unique piece about it?

Nivi: Right. So in the PayPal case: send money to friends online.

Sean: Yeah.

Nivi: OK.

Sean: Yeah. I think that would be… And at the time, that was fairly differentiated. Now you can use credit cards and other things, so something that remembers your log-in information might be trying to differentiate from just Visa or Master Card or American Express.

Sean: But what I was going to say with that is that there are two periods where that becomes important. One, before you have product/market fit you’re trying to find that signal, so you can do some sort of early positioning to try to highlight that. But the problem is, too much positioning is going to steer your users in a certain direction. So, early on, a lot of times it’s good to actually be very feature-function oriented.

Nivi: OK.

Sean: Because unless you have a real strong signal…. You can experiment with it, like, OK, let’s bring people in and we’ll give them this message and we’ll see what their very-disappointed number does, just on this group of people. We’ll survey them separately.

But in general, if you don’t have a real strong signal, then it can be kind of dangerous to shape their experience by highlighting some unique attributes that turn out not to be the important unique attributes.

Nivi: Because it might be inconsistent with…?

Sean: Because you’re going to shape their experience so much that they may miss the other thing that would have been the thing that would really thrill them.

Nivi: Right. So give me an example of how I would do that.

Sean: X Corp. is a prime example on that. In the early days at X Corp., it was just one of those things that I realized that if I really focused on homepage messaging it was going to take me a really long time to get some level of consensus, and that’s just the way that the business….

The way most startups operate, early on, is that everyone has opinion around what the homepage looks like and what it says. And so, what I realized is that getting a lot of those early users, we were going to be getting them through search anyway, so I basically said I’d let everyone else figure out what’s going to be on the homepage, I’m just going to take people in through landing pages.

With landing pages you know what the person’s intent is when they’re coming in through a specific search word, so you can really hone things in a more segmented way.

But our homepage ended up being very feature-function oriented, and the group we initially built the product for ended up being a relatively small percentage — especially on a revenue side — of where the business ultimately ended up generating a lot of revenue. So I think if I had taken a traditional marketing approach to that I would have been very benefit-oriented right from the beginning. And I probably would have positioned it away from what ended up being the really interesting market for us, because I would have given so many details about how they should use the product that this other group may not even have considered using the product.

And so, as a result of having, essentially a group of engineers be able to initially determine the wording for the homepage, they just focused on the features that they created, with not a lot of why someone would need it. And that turned out to be the best thing that could happen because, ultimately for us, by the time I really started looking for that signal, the signal was very different than what we would have initially had if I had positioned out of the gate for that.

Sean: A big theme that I keep coming back to is, where is the love? It’s basically just finding out which users are passionate about the product. What is the use case on the product that those people have? Why do they actually love the product? And that gives you a good core of information to guide every part of your business. So messaging, you want to reflect that, but also, now that you know that, you want to make sure that you can really get a lot more people to that particular type of use case and that particular type of gratifying experience. So understanding user gratification is really critical in all of it.

First of all, you want to know that you have enough that you can try to grow the business — that you actually have something that will be growable. And then in growing the business, having that gratification should give you guidance on everything. So product roadmap should be a function of how people are gratified with the product and who’s gratified, so it should give you a lot more focus on that product roadmap as opposed to a lot of feature feedback and ideas and different things that, over time…

You know, initially you have to kind of scatter-shoot it. You have to cast a fairly wide net of things that might please people, but once you really know where that gratification is, that’s where you really want to double down, and that’s your business. Before, everything’s an experiment. But your business is really on where that gratification or where that love is.

Nivi: Does that go to what is the primary benefit of the product in your Survey.io?

Sean: Yes. That’s where I start to see it. I start to see it in each of those questions. I can start to see, in the very-disappointed question there’s a: why did they pick that? You can start to see it in there, as well.

Ultimately, that’s the first thing that I’m trying to look at. One, do enough people love this product? And two, why do they love this product? And then everything that I’m doing is basically helping the business to — I wouldn’t say reposition, because reposition is associated with messaging — realign itself around that really strong user gratification. And once you have that alignment around that, it gives you a lot more direction.

Early on, everything is an assumption, everything is vision, but once you have users on there you can finally start to find that nugget of value.

Sean: And one of the things, if you really step back and ask a lot of entrepreneurs why startups fail, a lot of people rightly focus on lack of focus as being what causes a lot of startups to fail. But then the question is, OK, if it’s lack of focus, what should you be focused on? Obviously, lots of focus on the wrong thing is still going to cause you to fail, so then it’s a big question of what you should be focused on. And for me, ultimately it’s that strong signal that this is something that users really love about the product. So understanding who loves that product — who really has that need — that starts to give you guidance on who you’re going to target going forward.

What other things can we do that can enhance that use case — that can make that particular use case? How can we prioritize those feature enhancements, the parts of the product roadmap that relate to that, and maybe drop some of the things that are the wild cards that we’ve had in there for a while?

The thing that amazes me is a lot of startups have got a little side-product project of a completely unrelated product or something else, which I think, early on when you don’t have product/market fit, is probably not a bad idea. You’re throwing a lot of stuff out there to start to see what sticks.

But once you’ve found that signal, you’re ahead of 90% of the startups out there. So once you find that strong signal, your ability to be really successful is focusing on that strong user gratification and passion and figuring out how to get more users to it, more of the right types of users to it. How can we make it even better — but, that part better, not all parts better, that part better?

Sean: How can we completely refine that brand experience?

Now is the time to go and get a better designer to come in and really get the graphics perfect on that part. Now is the time to bring in someone who is the absolute wordsmith to get the descriptions perfect on the website, but making sure that they’re being very responsive to that user feedback and they’re not just being a wordsmith by what they think is what’s important to people.

Nivi: Business model?

Sean: Business model is absolutely a function of that. You want to make sure that you are not trying to monetize something that’s not important to users. If users tell you they’d be very disappointed without it, the other thing that they’re telling you is that you could keep cranking that price up for a long time before they change to being somewhat disappointed without it.

And if you’re really focusing on that to determine your price and how you charge for the product, you’re going to have a lot more signals.

Sean: So I think that’s a big theme that startups should look at, is focus, and focus on what and when.

The “when” — early on your focus is on just trying to find some love within your product. Find somebody who loves something about your product. And you can get that day one, before your product is even developed, just by talking to people and saying: Hey, this is the problem that we think people have out there and this is how we’re going to try and solve that. Does that seem like something that would be useful for you?

Nivi: The customer development approach.

Sean: Yeah, the customer development approach. Steve Blank has a really good book that’s documenting everything on that and has written a lot more about that.

I purposely, again, have stayed out of that area because it’s so high risk, and you can’t be good at everything so that’s the part that I’ve said I’m not going to try to be good at.

But essentially from day one, it’s all about that search for something that somebody really needs.

Nivi: Going back to the must-have — that metric — you don’t see user recommendation in that metric there, as well?

Sean: It’s interesting; I see a lot of correlation on success in businesses with the must-have.

I had somebody contact me recently who had a 70% must-have number and they are adding 20,000 new users a day with great monetization, and they just started recently. It was just one of those things that wasn’t surprising to me to see all that success because they have that strong must-have number without really even having a marketer in the company.

So the must-have, I think, is really big, but there are a lot of people that have good recommendation numbers that struggle, and part of that is that… I think YouTube videos is a prime example that sometimes you just see some really funny things that you want to share with other people, but ultimately would you be very disappointed if you couldn’t? Probably not.

Nivi: Right. So it could be a false-positive. But let’s say for the folks that do have the 40% must-have, do you see a correlation of recommendations then?

Sean: Not necessarily. Sometimes I see it really high. A company that I surveyed today, with surveys rolling in right now, was 90% recommend rate, but sometimes I see it being pretty low on a company that’s doing really well. Sometimes I see, as I said before, companies that are pretty low on the must-have, but high on the recommendation rate. So I actually don’t think that’s a good proxy for success, but I haven’t studied it enough to know for sure.

The only thing that I do know is, on the must-have number, I’ve probably looked at 150 companies now on that number and I could maybe point to one or two that were less than 40% that had any kind of traction and success. And over 40%, everybody had some success. And maybe it’s 35%, maybe it’s 45%, but somewhere around there you get enough people.

The only thing I tend to find a challenge with is that some companies have a must-have number that’s around 40%, but then the feedback is all over the board on why they consider it a must-have and that becomes really hard for being able to find any kind of signal to base the business on. So that’s a different problem, and I haven’t figured out how to deal with that.

Nivi: There are too many segments in the customer base.

Sean: Yeah. Everybody loves it, but for different reasons. Then maybe you have to figure out which one of those reasons represents the biggest target user group and hone in on that.

Nivi: Right. One thing you talk about is, once you have the product/market fit, trying to get through the next few steps as quickly as possible. So it would be great if you could talk about that, and also, for people that don’t know what the pyramid looks like, what are the next few steps?

Sean: Sure. As I said, if you don’t have product/market fit, you want to be obsessively focused on getting there, however you’re defining product/market fit. I think the easiest kind of definition to work toward is trying to get 40% of your users to say they’d be very disappointed without it.

And during that period you’re trying to stay very low burn and very conservative on all of your expenses within the business. And once you find 40% of your users that say they’d be very disappointed without the product, then you’re in a position that you have a business that can grow now. So then the question is: do you try to grow the business right then or are there some things that you can still do that are going to make it even easier to grow when you’re focused on that? And what I’ve found in working with so many companies at this stage is that you’re definitely better off waiting a little time until you try to grow the business.

Nivi: And what does it mean to grow the business? You’re talking about spending money to acquire users, essentially.

Sean: Acquiring users, for a lot of businesses, means starting to spend money, but it might also mean really trying to crank up the virality of the business, or it might be SEO that doesn’t require a lot of spending.

Nivi: But it’s time and money that you require for people… [interrupted]

Sean: Yeah, and focus. The time piece, you could say, has time or focus. But it’s essentially saying…

"# How to bring a product to market Part 2 — after productmarket fit

“Where the #@!*% is Part 2?”

That’s what I’ve been hearing since we published Part 1 of our rare interview with Sean Ellis.

Here’s part 2.

In Part 1, Sean discussed what you do before product/market fit: how to get there, how to measure it, and how to survey your users so you can improve fit.

In Part 2, he explains what you do after fit: optimizing your positioning, implementing a business model, and optimizing your funnel — all so you’re prepared to acquire users quickly and profitably.

If you don’t know Sean from his blog or tweets, he lead marketing from launch to IPO filing at LogMeIn and Uproar. His firm, 12in6, then worked with Xobni (Khosla), Dropbox (Sequoia), Eventbrite (Sequoia), Grockit (Benchmark)…  the list goes on. 12in6 “helps startups unlock their full growth potential by focusing on the core value perceived by their most passionate users.”

This is the first time Sean has done an interview on the record. I’m really psyched he’s making his insights public — this interview is a must-listen.

Music: The Equator by Tortoise


Nivi: Right. One thing you talk about is, once you have the product/market fit, trying to get through the next few steps as quickly as possible. So it would be great if you could talk about that, and also, for people that don’t know what the pyramid looks like, what are the next few steps?

Sean: Sure. As I said, if you don’t have product/market fit, you want to be obsessively focused on getting there, however you’re defining product/market fit. I think the easiest kind of definition to work toward is trying to get 40% of your users to say they’d be very disappointed without it.

And during that period you’re trying to stay very low burn and very conservative on all of your expenses within the business. And once you find 40% of your users that say they’d be very disappointed without the product, then you’re in a position that you have a business that can grow now. So then the question is: do you try to grow the business right then or are there some things that you can still do that are going to make it even easier to grow when you’re focused on that? And what I’ve found in working with so many companies at this [post-fit] stage is that you’re definitely better off waiting a little time until you try to grow the business.

Nivi: And what does it mean to grow the business? You’re talking about spending money to acquire users, essentially.

Sean: Acquiring users, for a lot of businesses, means starting to spend money, but it might also mean really trying to crank up the virality of the business, or it might be SEO that doesn’t require a lot of spending.

Nivi: But it’s time and money that you require for people… [interrupted]

Sean: Yeah, and focus. The time piece, you could say, has time or focus. But it’s essentially saying…

Sean: Is now the time to orient — especially the CEO and the marketing group and maybe a sales group — is now the time to build up that group and just say, let’s step on the accelerator and do everything that we can to get very aggressive about growing this business? And I would say, not quite.

The reason being, one, up until this point you shouldn’t have really focused on really trying to get the metrics into your business, so one of the ways that you can effectively grow a business today is, you can experiment in lots of different areas and figure out, in which areas do I invest a dollar and get that dollar paid back the most quickly or make a really strong return on the investment? But you can’t do that if you don’t have the measurement systems in place. So one of the first steps that you want to do is specify what metrics you really need to be tracking in order to be able to grow this business. And you want to then work to implement those.

So, to some degree, Google Analytics can help you, but the problem with Google Analytics is that you don’t really have tracking on a very user-specific level. So maybe you can track with Google Analytics or with Website Optimizer, even with Google AdWords with action tags, you can track a first transaction through dollars spent, but what you can’t track is lifetime value. And ultimately, expected lifetime value is what you should be basing your customer acquisition investments on.

Nivi: With the per-user tracking, is that what KISSmetrics is for?

Sean: That’s what KISSmetrics is working on. For other companies that I’ve worked with, it’s basically been database driven reports where we’re cookie-ing users when they’re coming in to track them back to the source, and we’re recording that information in the user’s permanent record in the database, and that way any revenue that’s generated from that user, we’re able to tie back to the money that was spent on that referring origin, coming in.

The reason why I started working closely with KISSmetrics is that all of my projects were six months, and that type of a system that I just described tends to be fairly complicated, especially as you start to track where you’re losing users along the way, and some of the other pieces. It was taking a big chunk of the time that we had together to implement that, and there were a lot of bottlenecks around it, so I was trying to find someone who could build that type of a solution as an off-the-shelf type solution and KISSmetrics was on their way to doing something like that. So I’ve been advising them for a couple of years to try to get the full vision out there of something that can really give the metrics that any business needs to be able to drive and manage growth.

Sean: So metrics is just one part of it. Obviously, as I started to touch on right there a second ago, most companies initially have a very inefficient customer-acquisition process. So it’s not just how effectively can you spend money externally, but how can you convert people once they get to your website to having a gratifying first experience, and then ultimately buying your product? And metrics are a good way of determining experiments that you run along the way — how can I get more and more people to actually convert?

That can be through landing-page testing. You can be really effective on that front, or all the way down to just testing purchase prompts. There are all different areas, so you want to have a pretty sophisticated measurement system in place to do that.

I’ve worked with businesses where, at the start of that process to the end of that process, in a matter of just a couple of months, we’ve seen five times as many people purchasing just by more efficiently on-ramping them into the product and converting them into being paying customers, which means that when we then focused on trying to grow the business and buy growth, we could spend five times as much money to get someone to the website at the same return on investment, after that process.

And when you can spend five times as much money to get someone to the website, there are a lot more viable marketing channels that are open to you — a lot of times channels that would not have been effective at all before. If you’re putting a dollar in and you’re only getting 50 cents back, after you’ve gone through this process and you try that channel again and now you’re putting a dollar in and you’re getting $2.50 back, you’re going to put as many dollars as possible into that channel, and you would have cut it previously.

Nivi: And the expected LTV of the user is equal to your allowable acquisition cost per user. Is that right?

Sean: That would be your allowable acquisition cost for a break even. It kind of depends on what your objectives are. If you’re trying to do market share you might even be buying users at a loss initially. If you’re trying to generate a profit, you probably want to build in some profit on that.

Nivi: Right. So, we put the testing in place. What other steps are we going to do before we grow?

Sean: So messaging. You want to make sure that you’ve got good messaging. So part of that was to get the product/market fit. You might be doing some positioning and messaging. But this is where you want to do a lot of landing page optimization and fine tuning just to see, what’s the best way to convert users coming in?

Nivi: In terms of positioning.

Sean: Ultimately in terms of converting them, positioning is part of that. To me, positioning is sort of the qualitative side and then testing and optimization is the quantitative way of getting to the best result. Hopefully, where you end up is somewhat consistent with what your positioning usage led you.

Nivi: And what are your thoughts on just going through this whole process as quickly as possible?

Sean: That’s a good question. The mistake that I’ve seen a lot of companies make, particularly those that struggled to get to product/market fit, is that the whole mentality while you’re trying to get to product/market fit is to be super conservative and not spend very much money, so a lot of companies kind of [say]: OK, we got there. Now let’s prepare to grow.

And they, again, are really conservative and they’re taking six months to…. A prime example would be: I need to spend $100 a day or $200 a day to know that this is the best-performing landing page, or home page even, or I need to send 1,000 people or 10,000 people through there, and most people will space it out over two weeks. They’ll say they don’t want to spend more than $100 a day while we figure that out, so we’ll space it out over two weeks.

In reality, if you have some place where you can spend the money — let’s say you’re doing that through a Google campaign and you’re not getting the cap on that, but you’re saying, I just don’t want to spend more than $100 a day, you’re essentially going to spend exactly the same amount of money to get to the answer if that’s a good page or not. One way it’s going to take you two weeks; one way is going to take you one day. If you consider that time is money as well, then you’re closer to being able to accelerate the business after one day than you would have been otherwise and it costs you the same. But it’s just really hard I think, a lot of times, for people to go through that mentality.

Sean: Another example would be if you are tight on graphic design resources internally, if you test 50 landing pages or 100 landing pages or 1,000 landing pages, you’re going to be so much more efficient at being able to drive growth in your business that it just doesn’t make sense, if your big bottleneck is on graphic design, then you want to bring in two or three people. Pay them a little bit more. It’s a temporary spike in costs to get much faster to the point where you’ve got a lot more landing pages in there.

So you combine those two things. We’re going to spend more to get people through, and we’re going to be able to test five landing pages at a time rather than just two. So being able to do all of those things… The goal should really be….

Sean: You have two low-burn periods in the business. The first is pre-product/market fit. You’re trying to spend the least amount possible. 

And then the second low-burn period is once you accelerate the business you’re working within the parameters of your allowable acquisition costs, so you can actually go to being cash-flow positive pretty quickly at that point.

One of the companies that I worked with, once we got through this period of — it took us about four months to transition to being able to really accelerate the business and we got it to the point where we could scale marketing to close to a million dollars a month with a fast payback on those marketing dollars.

And at that point we had to raise some more money to be able to fund those campaigns. We raised the money on some very proven metrics and went cash-flow positive the month after we raised the money. So it shows that if we had taken 16 months to go through and really optimize that experience, it probably would have taken a lot longer to get the cash flow positive, but we were very focused and aggressive on it through that period of time and could really accelerate that business in a very cash-efficient way once we got through that period.

Sean: The mistake that most people make is they’re trying to manage growth and optimization at the same time. For this period of time, growth isn’t important. That’s the other thing that’s really hard for people to consider. That is not the objective — efficiency is the objective.

So for the first part of the pyramid, the base of the pyramid, you’re just trying to create a product that’s good enough, that people want, so growth is definitely not important.

A lot of companies still pat themselves on the back if they grow faster than expected through that period. You shouldn’t, because what happens, especially if you go to your VCs and you pat yourself on the back publicly to them, then you’re essentially saying growth is important to us, and you’re setting expectations that they should want more of it. So basically, say: Hey, we grew. That’s not what we were trying to do yet, but it’s positive on the hope for the business, but before we really focus on growth we want to get our product/market fit number to this.

Now, in this case, basically we want to be able to grow as efficiently as possible when we’re focused on it. And so what we want to do is build in efficiency in the business and the customer acquisition monetization.

Sean: So this is the time when you put in the business model as well, because you can’t spend real aggressively if you aren’t confident that you’re going to get that return on the investment.

A lot of companies make the mistake of… at least I believe it’s a mistake. This is probably one of the most debatable things that I say; a lot of companies believe they can grow faster without a business model. To me, having seen companies that can arbitrage dollars to grow and do it really effectively, you can just accelerate the business so much with that, why would you not spend money to grow? But you can’t do that if you don’t have a business model in place. So that’s why I tend to want to put a business model in place at that point.

The mistake of trying to put a business model in earlier, before you have product/market fit, is that you don’t know if you’re charging for the right things in the right way. You may be charging for things that are totally irrelevant for people and giving away stuff that is really important to people. So that’s one of the big reasons I like to delay the business model until, one, I have product/market fit, and two, I know why I have product/market fit — I know why people love the product.

Sean: Now I’m in a position to put the business model in place, work on all the efficiency on the customer acquisition side, and do everything so that when it comes time to focus on growth, the marketing group or the CEO or whoever is going to be managing that process can be completely focused on driving growth — they’re experimenting with lots of channels and finding those that work and killing those that don’t, and basically just as quickly as they can, adding as many new customer acquisition sources to the mix.

And you shouldn’t focus on that until you know how to efficiently convert people and until you have a product that people really need. So that’s why this pyramid just gives you the idea that until you have really achieved that level, and if you’re trying to do multiple things at the same time, you’re not going to give things the necessary focus to actually accomplish them.

And your goal is ultimately to be growing a product that has very efficient conversion, that you’ve got all of the metrics in place to really manage that growth, you’ve got a product that people love, and at that point you’re starting to become a regular company. You’re organized into product teams and marketing and sales and finance and all of those things that are needed to create an efficient, high-growth company that can manage that growth and not implode under that growth.

That’s really why in that center period of time, it’s exciting. What should be driving you, day in and day out, is that we’re close. We’re right to the point where we’re almost going to accelerate the business.

Sean: So, one other piece that I think fits into this is that a lot of times it requires a lot of experimenting with how you introduce people to your product. What do you show them first? What is that whole first user experience?

The mistake a lot of companies make is that they try to get that first user experience right before they have product/market fit, so those companies are essentially pulling limited resources off of their core product and saying: we’re going to focus those resources on getting that first user experience right. Then that means that they’re not really dealing with the problem. They can maybe get twice as many people in to experience the product, but it still sucks. So they’re not really dealing with the issue.

But now everybody who comes in, or a big chunk of people who come in, are saying that they’d be very disappointed without this product — there’s a lot of love for that product. At that point, basically hitting the pause button on core-product development for two months isn’t even going to hurt the business because people already love it, and taking all of those resources that would have been focused on honing that core-product development, and refocusing those on: How do you introduce people to that? What does that first user experience look like?

The mistake that a lot of companies make is that they’ll take one person off to do that, and it’s going to take them a lot longer to do the development to get that right. But now you’ve got that core-product experience right, taking the majority of your development resources to get through it in a few weeks is going to get you there faster and that is going to put huge dividends on your business.

Nivi: You’ll become master of your own destiny much more quickly. Right?

Sean: Yeah. The way that I’ve been able to get development teams excited about that is, one, I give them the context of the whole big picture, and then I essentially say this is not something that we’re going to ask you to keep coming back and refining the first user experience. Once we’ve really got it right, backed up by numbers, backed up by saying twice as many or three times as many or ten times as many people are getting in and experiencing that core-product experience, then you can go back into just working on that awesome core-product experience that you’ve created, and evolving that and just continuing to create a great product experience.

But otherwise, we’re going to have to keep asking you for help for the next six months, until we get that first user experience right. It’s just much better for everybody, for you guys, to put the pause button on that, help us get this right, and then we’re going to be able to grow the business and it’s going to be a lot more exciting.

Nivi: And once you’re growing the business, what do you think about growing quickly to eliminate slack in the marketplace and basically leave no room for the competition?

Sean: Once you have product/market fit, and once others see you having traction, you’re going to attract a lot of copycats into the business. And they should be trying to come in because, like I said, the product/market fit is kind of the hardest thing to get to, so once somebody sees that you have a lot of passionate users who really love it, it’s the easiest way to create a moderately successful business — to knock that off.

So you have a short-term advantage, which is you’re able to respond to all the real product feedback that you’re getting from users who are coming in and experiencing that, so you can start to evolve your product better.

So partly what you want to do is just buy every related keyword, maxed out, and be very efficient on those keywords so that you can spend a lot more money on them acquiring users. So, the next guy can’t even consider spending keywords, so you’ve killed that channel for them. You just want to basically make it so that by the time someone can respond, it’s going to take them several months to be able to come out with something that’s close to your product. By the time they come in there, there’s just no market left for them to play in — you’re really redlining that market.

It’s interesting. In companies that I’ve been with through the growth period, the products that come easiest are the ones that often get the least focus because, oh, we’re hitting the targets on those numbers. We have to work harder on these other numbers. But it’s always the products where the growth comes easiest where the competition comes in because we didn’t take the slack out of the market in those products, and then suddenly competition that we didn’t expect, and then it’s not so easy to grow any more.

Sean: I think all of the things that I’ve talked through are a snapshot of what I think is best right now. There are so many exceptions in the different types of businesses that are out there. For example, marketplaces do need to focus on growth a lot earlier. Their business is a function of the people that are on there and how they’re using the product, and the experience changes for everybody else with more people on the product. eBay would be a good example of that.

I think each of these things are some of the guidance that I wish I had in the startups that I was in, but don’t just take it exactly as-is and think you can just plug it right on your business and that it will work. You need to sort of interpret what this means for your business.

Nivi: Do you have any experience applying any of this theory to marketplaces at all?

Sean: Yeah, Y Corp. is a company that I’ve worked with that is a marketplace that I’ve definitely learned a lot and learned that it’s different than a lot of the companies, like Dropbox or Xobni, where it’s a more specific product that, with a million users or fifty users, there would be experience where the product doesn’t change that much, where for Y Corp. the experience changed a lot.

Nivi: So how do you still take a thoughtful approach when you’re building a marketplace?

Sean: It’s just a lot more complicated. I think, for me, one of the things that’s kind of come out, in my head, on marketplaces is that you probably need deeper pockets for it. You don’t have the luxury of focusing quite as laser focused on each of the steps in the pyramid that I talked about — that you actually do need to think about growth earlier on, and that even when you’re then focused on growth you need to make sure that you’re constantly finding out if the love is moving, if it’s on something else. It’s just a lot more dynamic to try. It’s fun. It’s interesting, but it’s definitely harder.

And I’ve had enough conversations with other people from dating sites to anything that’s got the experience based on the mix of people that are there, that it’s really something that affects any businesses like those. So that’s one piece that, don’t just feel like you can plug this in directly. There are probably exceptions for a lot of these things.

Nivi: Why did you decide to focus on startup marketing, and why is it important to you and how did you come to that conclusion?

Sean: It actually happened when I was coming off of LogMeIn and figuring out what I was going to do after LogMeIn. I knew that the company had gotten big enough that it was not really the size that I wanted to be working in anymore, and that I wanted to go back to early stage.

So it was more just thinking, OK, I can jump into another startup and hopefully I can be fortunate enough to get into a startup where it has the success. But just looking at realistic startup success rates, LogMeIn was the second in a row of two startups that I had run marketing from launch through a NASDAQ IPO filing, and I just knew, realistically, that there was not a good chance that I was going to be able to do that with a third one.

And so partly what I was looking at was just in general…. I kind of went through the thought process of: did I just get completely lucky, which certainly had something to do with it, or were there some things that we did that actually led to that success? And when I really started thinking through both of the companies, I came to the conclusion that the hardest part and the part that really mattered in building a successful company, was what we did in the first year, and really just figuring out everything about the business: Who really needs this product? Why do they need it? How are we going to charge for it? How are we going to acquire new users?

All of these things that needed to be figured out, once we had them figured out then it was much more about, OK, now how do we get more users? But a lot of the moving parts had stabilized at that point and we could really focus on just getting more new users. And so I thought, if that’s really the most important part, I thought that it was also the most challenging part, and so future success that I have is really going to be based on how well I can do that first part.

And then I realized that in 10 years, across these two startups, I’d only spent one or two years in that really challenging stage, so if I really wanted to get good at that I was going to need to figure out how to work in that stage a lot.

And the problem with startups is that every person working in a startup full-time, basically has an option vesting period that’s usually about four years on those initial options. So you work really hard in the beginning and you get some level of success and then it takes another four years to be compensated for that success, so there’s no way you’re going to create all this success and then leave the company right away.

So for me it was more about: how can I work really hard in that stage and actually be compensated for it? The only thing that I really figured would be the best way to structure it would be as an interim VP marketing role, and I was introduced, from one of the investors in LogMeIn, to a company that was in his portfolio called Xobni. They were still in private beta, and he said just talk to the guys. So we had a conversation that ended up extending for a couple of hours and we really bonded over some things.

And I got excited about the product and they got excited about potentially working with me and tried to bring me in long-term, full-time, and that was not something I wanted to jump right into. I was really passionate about figuring out this early stage and doing cycles there. So we decided that it made sense to pursue an interim VP marketing role. So I basically went there and thought, I’ll do interim VP marketing role after interim VP marketing role, for the next several years — essentially negotiate my exit before I came in so that I’d be able to keep a reasonable amount of options. That was the initial plan, and the whole idea was just to get the experience, up front, and practice, up front, to get good at that and to really document what’s important and what’s not important.

I think the challenge that I figured out was that, really, on the marketing side, there’s a lot of bottlenecks to get a lot of the things done, like optimization and trying to get resources to do a lot of those things. Everybody’s scrambling to get the overall product out.

So I knew a lot of what needed to be done, but there’s just a lot of waiting around until you have the tools that you need to do that. So where I’m looking at everyone around me working 14 hours a day, and wanting to put that time in myself, there just wasn’t that much to do. So I almost felt guilty that I wasn’t putting in the same amount of effort that everybody else was, so I still spent the time in the office, but I just found myself doing a lot of things that maybe weren’t that important.

That was why, after Xobni, I decided that I was going to do a more leveraged model where I could work with a couple of companies where they actually had somebody inside to manage the execution of things, but that I would actually be more on the outside, being able to not spend more time in the company than I needed to spend. So that’s why I did Dropbox and Eventbrite in that sort of way, where I was balancing two companies at once, and that worked pretty well.

Sean: I feel like I’m still just scratching the surface on what can be learned in early-stage startups. There are not a lot of people that have deep enough experience and frequent enough experience in that really critical up-front stage to get good at it. It’s been fun to try and figure it out, but there’s a big variety of companies. There are certain things that I think are applicable to all businesses.

One of the most important discoveries in the last couple of years, since I’ve been focused on this stage, is figuring out this very-disappointed number and just understanding that trying to grow a business that doesn’t have users that would be disappointed without it, or don’t consider the product a must-have, is going to be a difficult and frustrating experience for anybody, including me. It’s humbling. I can’t do it.

I can’t do it very well, and when I see companies doing it I have a lot of admiration for them to be able to grow a business that is weak on that [fit] number. Those are the hard-core marketers that are kind of too good for their own good, because they’ve basically allowed the business not to focus on what the core issue is that’s holding them back. But those people would really benefit from taking a step back and tightening up some of these things.

I’m doing an experiment with Webs.com, for example, that is a later-stage company. They’ve been around for a long time. They’re a top-100 website and have a ton of user passion and a lot of the things that I’ve done to help prepare companies to grow are things that Webs hadn’t done, so we’re working together to see if we can retroactively put some of these things in place to accelerate their business.

And for me it’s all about learning and just experimenting in companies to find out what’s unique to startups and what’s unique to later-stage companies and what applies to everything.

Nivi: Great! That’s great. I just want to say thanks very much, Sean, for talking to us.

"# How to close a term sheet quickly

How do you quickly turn a signed term sheet into cash in the bank? I’ve seen entrepreneurs do it in one week and I’ve seen them do it in four weeks.

How do you do it as quickly as possible?

Listen to our podcast below for the details.





Audio: How to close a term sheet quickly (mp3)

Nivi: I was talking to a couple of entrepreneurs today about how to expedite the closing process. Closing is when you go from a signed term sheet to money in the bank.

You are taking the signed term sheet, which is really just a letter of intent; it is for the most part non-binding, except for some confidentiality and no shop clauses, and turning it into a set of closing documents and money in the bank.

Closing can take anywhere from one week, to four weeks, to six weeks, depending on the complexity of the closing. There are some things that you just can’t speed up. There may be legal diligence that needs to be done that just can’t be expedited. It takes time to get it done.

Other than those issues that you can’t really speed up any faster than they are going, it is really up to the entrepreneur to set the timetable for closing. You can set things up so it gets done in a week and you can set things so it gets done in four weeks.

My preference is to get it done quickly for a few reasons. One: It just reduces the risk of not closing. Two: The faster you get it done the quicker you can get back to building your business. Three: It is just good experience and practice to move things forward during negotiations with your lawyers, with the other side’s lawyers, and with the other side.

There are three parts to closing quickly. One: What you do before you sign the term sheet. Two: After you sign a term sheet, what you do on your end to make sure things are moving quickly. Three: After you sign a term sheet what you do to make sure the other side is moving quickly. Lets cover each of those parts.

First lets talk about what you do before you sign a term sheet. Number one, most term sheets have a clause or term in there that indicates what the expected closing date is so your lawyers, the other side’s lawyers, and the other side can all work together towards that date.

My next suggestion is to conduct all your business diligence before you sign the term sheet so there is no business diligence left to do once you have signed the term sheet, during the closing process.

A lot of startups, I think, make the mistake of signing a term sheet too quickly before the investors have made the decision to really invest in the company. And they are just locking the company up with the term sheet, taking the company off the market so they can do their real diligence.

I would prefer to get all the business diligence done before I sign the term sheet. And we have a blog post on this, look it up. It is called, Complete business diligence before you sign a term sheet. We have also got another blog post called, Discuss your plans before signing a term sheet.

You also want to complete as much legal diligence as makes sense and is possible before you sign a term sheet as well. Why leave some legal risks? Why take yourself off the market and expose yourself to the risks that there is some legal issue that is going to trip up the financing. You want to get as much of that done before you sign the term sheet as well. You can find more info on that in the blog post. For most seed stage investment there is not a lot of complexity in your legal documents, whether it is IP or existing contracts, or what have you.

And top tier investors aren’t going to try to push business diligence to after a signed term sheet, in general. And if they do they are pretty up front about it and there is usually a good reason why. If you are working with a good firm you will get the business diligence done before you sign a term sheet anyway. And if you are a seed stage startup without a lot of complexity the legal work is pretty turnkey, which means that you can get it done quickly. And it is really up to you to determine how long it is going to take. These financing closings take as long as you let them take.

How do you expedite the closing process? There are two parts to this. The first part is making sure your lawyers move quickly. The second part is making sure the other side moves quickly. The other side consists of the fund and their lawyers.

First lets talk about making sure your side moves quickly. You should understand that you are in a very high leverage position with respect to your lawyers. Your lawyers have taken the risk of working with you while you were an unfunded, seed state startup with a lot of risk that you would go out of business.

They perhaps deferred fees, or gave you reduced rates. And they took on the risks of working with you with the hopes that you would be come a venture backed startup and grow on to great success and do a lot of business with them. Which is exactly what is starting to happen to you at this point in time, you are getting venture backed. You have a signed term sheet.

Your lawyers are in a pretty precarious position. They have taken a lot of risks and that risk is starting to bear fruit. But they are in a position where they are not locked-in in any way. You are not locked-in with them so you can terminate them at any point in time still. If you terminate them they have taken a bunch of risks, worked for reduced rates, deferred fees, and they weren’t interested in working with you while you were a seed stage company. They just did that to build the relationship so that you could work with them when you were a venture back startup spending lots of money on legal fees. If you terminate them, they won’t be able to reap what they sowed. So they’re in a precarious position. You have a lot of leverage over them.

The first thing to do to expedite the closing process is talk to my lawyers and tell them — if you haven’t already, which hopefully you’ve done — is tell them you’re going to measure them in four ways. High quality advice, one. Two, the speed at which they get things done for you. Three, the number of errors in the work product. Four, cost.

Next, you tell your lawyers that you want to have an extremely firm date for the closing process. You can take the Steve Blank approach there, if you like, and tell them that prior to that date, if they need help you are available to help them out, but when that date comes you don’t want any excuses. Right? If they come at you with excuses by that date, it’s really a fireable offense.

The best way to justify an extremely firm date is with a justification. People like to have reasons for why you want them to do things. So come up with a reason why the closing needs to happen by such and such date. For example, “I’m going on vacation on that date, I’m having a baby, I’m leaving to go to a business meeting in a foreign country, we need the money to make a payment, we need the money to hire somebody.” Just get with your team, brainstorm a solid reason why it absolutely has to be closed by that date.

That’s the end of the story of making your side move quickly. Ultimately, it’s really in the interests of your lawyers to actually get it done quickly. We’ve seen too many law firms get fired after a closing because the closing wasn’t done quickly enough, there were too many errors and the entrepreneurs were not happy with it. I think it’s important and good for the law firm for you to communicate what your metrics for success are. Finally, your lawyers are not computers, right? They’re humans. So don’t take the tone of the discussion here too literally. You want to treat them with grace and humility and make them excited to work with you.

The other piece of the puzzle is getting the other side to move quickly on the closing and getting the other side’s lawyers to move quickly on the closing. In general, if you’re closing with a good firm, a good fund, they also want to close quickly. They don’t have any interest in a slow closing process. It’s just a question of getting their lawyer’s bandwidth.

The best advice I have to get the venture fund, or investors and their lawyers to move quickly, is to have a great BATNA. That’s really the only advice I have for you there. Preferably you’re in a situation where your BATNA has said something like, “If the other side blinks during the closing process, call me.” You want to have a BATNA that’s still chomping at the bit to invest in your company.

I’m not suggesting that you break any no shop clauses or anything like that, or confidentiality agreements that you have in your term sheet. What I am suggesting is prior to signing a term sheet, you want to have a BATNA that is chomping at the bit and will be interested in investing in your company even if the term sheet blows up after it’s signed. They’re chomping at the bit, like I said, they’ve said something like, “If the other side blinks during closing, call me.”

If they haven’t said something like that, you can say something like that. When you call the investors that you’re not going to take money from and tell them that you’re going to sign a term sheet with someone else, you can tell them, “If there’s any problem during the closing process you are going to be my first call. I’m not expecting any problems during the closing process, but in the odd case that there is a problem during closing and we decide to pull the plug, you are going to be my first call.”

So you’re setting things up to have a great alternative if things blow up during closing, and you’re providing yourself with an excuse. You’re saying, if things do blow up it’s not going to be them pulling the plug, it’s going to be me pulling the plug.

"# How to make a cap table

Summary: A cap table lists who owns what in a startup. It calculates how the option pool shuffle and seed debt lower the Series A share price. This post includes a fill-in-the-blank spreadsheet you can purchase to create your own cap table.

A capitalization (cap) table lists who owns what in a startup. It lists the company’s shareholders and their shares.

This screencast walks you through our cap table:



We used to charge for this stuff but now it’s free.


“This is great; we (probably like many other entrepreneurs) tried our hand at hacking up a similar spreadsheet on our own but this is a far more flexible and easy way of visualizing various scenarios. Thanks for putting this together.”

– Drew Houston, Founder of Dropbox

Many entrepreneurs think their pre-money valuation determines their percentage ownership of the company. They forget about the option pool shuffle. They forget about seed debt and its discount. Then they blame their lawyers.

Use this cap table to sketch out how much you will really own after the financing. Find something else to blame on your lawyers.

Our cap table includes the major economic levers of a Series A: common stock, preferred stock, options, and convertible debt. It doesn’t include warrants, vesting, debt interest, liquidation preferences, dividends, the Series B, et cetera.

Cap tables can be a little tricky to understand if you’ve never worked with one before. So we kept it simple.

Your lawyer or accountant will deal with the details that aren’t included in this cap table. They will maintain the company’s official cap table.

Use this spreadsheet to learn more about cap tables and what your cap table might look like. Then hire a lawyer to maintain the company’s official cap table.

This cap table is provided as-is, with no warranties. It is not legal advice. We make no representations that this cap table is accurate in any way or is fit for any purpose.

We do not take responsibility for anything that results from using this cap table, including, but not limited to, losing all your money and going to jail.

We are not lawyers. Get a lawyer.

Please leave your suggestions and questions in the comments and we’ll improve the cap table.

"# How to raise money without lying to investors

“Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.”

Niels Bohr, Nobel Prize winner



By penalizing entrepreneurs who are humble and honest about how their companies will grow, many investors cause entrepreneurs to over-promise (and later under-deliver) when they’re raising money.

The histories of some of the best-known technology companies demonstrate the power of luck, timing, the mistakes of incumbents, and solid execution.

Execution is the main tool under a startup’s control but it’s often under-valued by investors.

So it’s not surprising that most entrepreneurs come to pitch meetings armed with very precise statements about a very uncertain future and a list of proven strategies guaranteed to make their company successful. While sitting through these pitches, I sometimes wonder which is worse: the entrepreneurs who know they’re spinning tall tales or the ones who “got high on their own supply.”

Instead of bringing entrepreneurs back down to earth, some investors push them further into orbit. Some VCs ask a seed-stage, pre-product startup for a detailed five-year financial plan. When I was a partner at Polaris Ventures, I saw many of these spreadsheets built “for fundraising purposes.” We didn’t ask for these spreadsheets — entrepreneurs had usually built them after meeting other, less early-stage, investors.

I find the process of planning — and understanding how a founder thinks about a business — educational and valuable. But pushing the exercise to the point of assumptions layered upon assumptions is not just wasteful, but dangerous, because it sets the wrong expectations.

After a few pitches, entrepreneurs realize that the distant future is safer territory than the immediate. It’s easier to boast about 30 must-have features your product will have in three years, than to show the three must-have features in the current prototype. It’s easier to talk about how you’ll recruit world-class CXOs when you’re big and successful, than to show a detailed plan for bringing in an amazing inbound marketing specialist, when everyone on the team is getting paid below-market rates to conserve cash. The examples go on and on.

I’ve co-founded four companies. The two that most quickly and easily raised money did it with nothing but slide decks. Both were funded by Polaris, which has a lot of experience with very early stage investing. We didn’t waste time over-planning the future in those two companies.

And for good reason. Both startups ended up quite different than the fundraising presentations promised — for solid, market-based reasons that were invisible during diligence. Plinky acquired a new product line and became Thing Labs. 8th Ring failed quickly and cheaply, only seven months after funding. The CEO and I decided the execution risk was too high. And, in retrospect, we were right: our only competitor had an unexciting exit a few years later.

Over-promising is not a problem when it comes with over-delivery. But the overwhelming majority of startups fail to meet the promises they’ve made during fundraising. After years of observing this pattern, I’ve come to believe that over-promising can actually cause under-delivery. Entrepreneurs over-promise to raise money easily and set themselves up for pain down the road.

How? The reasons have to do with information signals, expectation setting, and the psychological contracts between entrepreneurs and investors. It’s very hard to pitch one story today and then change it the day the money hits the bank, especially if you’ve drunk the Kool-Aid.

An overly rosy pitch leads to expectations and fateful commitments that downplay the variability of the future. Decisions are made based on assumptions rather than tested hypotheses. The burn goes up earlier. The sales team is hired much too soon. In venture funds, over-promising also spreads from the investing partner to the rest of the partnership. It can also spread from the company to its customers and partners, further extending the reality distortion field.

If you’re Apple and you’ve got Steve, that’s awesome. For everyone else, it can get rough. I saw this play out with one of my companies that was expanding internationally (the reason why the company had raised money). The world was going to be our oyster and, before the reality that our go-to-market strategy wasn’t as effective as everyone had hoped set in, we had burned through a good chunk of capital.

How should you choose between being honest (and hearing “no” a lot) vs. amping up the pitch and risking the anti-patterns above? I give two answers to the CEOs I work with at my startup advisory firm FastIgnite.

First, I strongly advise startups to go to venture firms where the decision process is more collaborative and less “salesy.” One of the main reasons a VC will push an entrepreneur to over-promise is his need to sell a deal internally.

Second, pitch investors with a track record of valuing a team’s ability to execute, over any specific strategy or execution plan. While most firms pay lip service to this cliché, few do many investments this way. Here are some examples from my experience in the past few months:

The firms above practice a form of agile investing by (1) not forcing entrepreneurs to over-plan for an uncertain future and (2) following the principle of minimizing wasted effort. Ultimately, it’s the investors’ responsibility to reward honesty with trust and cash. And I think that’s a win-win. I’m looking forward to discussing this with you in the comments.

"# How to renegotiate with your customers — and not lose a single one

Mark Suster, entrepreneur turned VC at GRP Partners:

“When I was at BuildOnline (my first company) and things went ‘pear shaped’ we called all of our customers and said, ‘I know that we signed contracts with you. The reality is that the market has changed and I need to change to the new realities. We committed to product features. I can’t ship those as promised. I’m sorry. Do you like our product & service? Yes? Ok, thank you. Listen, I know that if you like what we do then you’ll want a healthy supplier/partner. I need to be able to earn a profit and with the contracts we’ve signed I cannot. I either need to cut product development staff (and therefore can’t ship products as promised) or I need to be able to charge you slightly more for our service or for features you want to see so that I can make ends meet. Help me understand which you prefer.’ I lost zero customers. In fact, we built tighter relationships. I had no choice and as they say, ‘necessity is the mother of all invention.'”

"# How to schedule meetings with investors


Image: Pink Floyd

Update: Here’s a simpler approach I like.

Scheduling meetings with investors — this topic is so banal you may wonder why someone needs to write about it all. But since we started AngelList, we’ve been making daily introductions between investment-grade startups and top-tier investors like Satish Dharmaraj (Posterous), Jeff Clavier (Mint), and Aaron Patzer (Milo). We see a lot of first time entrepreneurs trying to schedule meetings with investors.

This is not how you do it (based on a true story):

Shervin,

It is a pleasure to meet you. I would love to tell you more about Yomommaco. Next week we are at DEMO but the following week is wide open. Please let me know if there is a date/time that works for a meeting.

BTW, I am big admirer of some of your investments… KISSmetrics looks very interesting. Gowalla too.

Looking forward to speaking with you,

Yngwie Malmsteen
CEO, Yomommaco
777.212.2323

What’s wrong with this email? First, Yngwie proposes meeting in over a week — what’s wrong with right now? Second, he doesn’t propose any times to meet. Third, he doesn’t talk about the fact that he lives on the other side of the country. Fourth, he CC’ed me instead of moving me to BCC. Fifth, he makes an attempt to add a personal touch about KISSmetrics and Gowalla but he’s too colloquial (BTW?) and the touch isn’t personal at all — it’s just a list of company names.

This is how you do it (based on a true story):

Thanks Nivi (bcc'ed).

Shervin,

I'm back in SF on Wed 3/31. I could meet anytime the following day Thurs 4/1 after 3pm or Fri 4/2 before noon.

Since I won't be in SF for 10 days and we've already secured some commitments for the financing, why don't we get the conversation started with a 30 minute phone call anytime tomorrow Mon 3/22 after 2pm or Tue 3/23 after noon? My cell is 213.333.8923.

If you happen to be in Cambridge, MA anytime between now and 3/31, I could meet you there. Similarly, if you're in NYC in the next week,  I  could hop on a bus and make that work too.

I'm looking forward to talking.

Yngwie Malmsteem
213.333.8923

Respond immediately and be available to meet immediately. BCC the introducer. If you don’t live nearby, find out where the investor is (Plancast anyone?) and let them know if you’re going to be there soon. If you’re not going to be near them soon, propose a phone call. Propose specific times to talk. If there’s a deadline on the financing or you’re going to be oversubscribed, politely let them know. Write less — you have no idea how busy a typical investor’s inbox is. Don’t be colloquial. Attach a copy of your deck. Use an email program like Gmail that generates narrow  fucking columns. Don’t write HTML emails. Include a cell # and URL in the signature and not much more. Bonus: include one line of good news — or start the email with a substantive sentence about a mutual acquaintance or  something about the investor’s portfolio or blog or whatever.

P.S. Good news: we just hired Steve Wozniak. / Barney Rubble just committed to the financing. / We just had our first $1000 revenue day. / I got hair plugs and they look great.


Seed  financings get done through a positive feedback loop of social proof, scarcity and momentum. Focus on the financing, get it done, and get back to work.

"# How to share secrets in a negotiation

Last week, I spoke to a startup that was in discussions to license one of their products to a competitor. The competitor asked for historical sales data about the product, and the startup was wondering whether they should share that information with a competitor. Our conversation went like this:













The book I mentioned in the conversation is Bargaining for Advantage. It answers almost every negotiation question. I read the book cover-to-cover — that’s rare.

The answer to this particular problem starts on page 68 of Bargaining for Advantage and there’s a good summary on page 72:

“The solution here is to take your time and build trust step by step. It helps if you can use your relationship network to check the other party out. If that is not possible, take a small risk before you take a big one. See if those on the other side reliably reciprocate in some little matter that requires their performance based on trust. If they pass the test, you have a track record on which to base your next move.”

Almost every problem you run into in a startup is not unique. Someone else has had the same problem and knows how to solve it. With the right advisors (books, blogs, people), you can solve it the easy way, instead of the hard way (experience and failure). Save the risk and innovation for the important stuff.

P.S. If you’re sharing secrets with VCs, read these posts: Three things you should never tell a VC when fundraising and How to Deal with Skeletons in your Closet (and my comment).

"# How to write like the great entrepreneurs

Entrepreneurs are the best business writers in the world. If you can’t write, you can’t raise money. Or recruit. Or sell. 

I don’t know a single great entrepreneur who isn’t a great writer.

Good business writing is clear, compelling and concise. Read Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett (though they should have used half the words).

Here’s what I send my friends when they ask for writing tips:

1. Business writing is a customer service problem. You’re not the star—the reader is. Help them get what they want, as quickly and effectively as possible. They might want to solve a problem. They might want to be persuaded. Give ’em the goods.

2. Pretend you’re sending an email. Or a Slack message. It will calm your mind and yield better writing. 

3. Sum it up in a tweet. If the tweet isn’t compelling, the rest isn’t compelling. The ideal tweet absolves the reader from reading further. Sequoia says, “Summarize the company’s business on the back of a business card.”

4. Email it to yourself and read it on your phone. You’ll see the words with fresh eyes, as if someone else wrote them. This will force you to keep it short and simple.

5. Don’t write your thought process. The final draft shouldn’t mimic the path you took to come up with the idea. Instead, start the piece with a conclusion and make your best case.

6. Start with a summary. A good summary absolves the reader from reading further. But they will still want to.

7. Writing is rewriting. Write down your thoughts in a stream of consciousness. Don’t get hung up on diction. Then spend most of your time rewriting and reorganizing—sweat the details. I’m still rewriting posts days after I’ve published them.

8. Delete half the words. Say more with less. That’s good customer service. “If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.”

9. Avoid adjectives. Use numbers instead. An adjective is an admission that you don’t know the number.

10. Scrutinize every word for bias and rhetoric. Are they an ‘unruly mob’ or ‘patriots’? Perhaps neither—just call them by their name. Argue the other side of every word, at least to yourself.  Learn more about bias. 

11. Kill your darlings. Delete beautiful ideas and phrases if they don’t help the customer solve their problem.

12. Don’t apologize. Don’t qualify, apologize or anticipate arguments. Just say it. Some people will never understand that BOCTAOE. You can always put an FAQ at the end.

13. Use persuasion checklists like CLASSR and SUCCES. See the Appendix for details. 

14. Skim Strunk & White once in a while. You don’t need to read the whole book at once. Also read The Day You Became a Better Writer.

15. Break the rules once you learn the rules. Write in your authentic voice. Tell a story. Use adjectives. Write poetry. Learn which word choices unlock action. But first learn how to write clearly and concisely.

16. Writing is a design problem. Example: never use the idiom of ‘the former or the latter.’ It forces the reader to go back and figure out what you’re referring to. 

Learn design by reading Tufte, A Pattern Language and Don’t Make Me Think. Dieter Rams: “Indifference towards people and the reality in which they live is actually the one and only cardinal sin in design.”

Appendix

Consider adding a sentence for each of the CLASSR persuasion techniques: commitment, liking, authority, scarcity, social proof and reciprocity. Here’s a joke example by Victor Ghitescu: 

“Learn more about CLASSR by reading Influence by Cialdini. Do it because you like books that make you smarter. Do it for me, I’m an expert on this. The world’s best salespeople have all read it. Do it before the whole world finds out about it. You can thank me later.”

Make sure your writing is simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional, stories (SUCCES from Made to Stick):

“I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.”

"# How well do investors recruit

“Nearly 100% of the investors interviewed believe that they add value to their portfolio companies. Unfortunately… only 45% of the entrepreneurs interviewed indicated that they believe that was the case.”

— Matthew Louie and Cali Tran,
Harvard M.B.A. Students


Every investor claims to add value. But how much value do they really add? In particular, how well do they help with recruiting?

 Noam Wasserman, from the Harvard Business School, presents some interesting data in Investors (and Managers) as Headhunters:

“Investors provide leads to a significant subset of hired executives (an average of 18% of executive hires). However, they trail both the non-CEO members of the management team (who referred, on average, 29% of executive hires) and CEOs (36%).

“The major exceptions were for the CEO and CFO positions, for which the percentages [for investor leads] jumped to 28% and 30%.”


Translation: investors refer 18% of hired executives, employees refers 65%, and “other sources” refer the remaining 17%.

This data is consistent with our advice: hire investors for their money-add. Investors do add value, but you should assume their primary contribution will be money. Most of your value-add will come from employees, not investors.

Find an investor who will make an investment decision quickly, who is humble and trustworthy, who will treat you like a peer, who shares your vision, and is betting on you, not the market. If you’re lucky enough to find more than one of these investors, you can start thinking about which one will add the most value.

Finally, this survey is really interesting, but it measures averages. You don’t care how the average investor helps the average entrepreneur. You care about how your investor will help you. And the only way to figure that out is by  referencing your investors.

"# HubSpots founder on negotiating with investors

Dharmesh Shah recently wrote a very nice review of Venture Hacks. The article includes great meta-advice about fund raising:

“1.  VC Negotiation  Is An Art Form:  As an entrepreneur, there are few things more  “nuanced” that you’ll deal with than raising institutional capital.  Even if you  decide not to raise venture capital, a lot of these skills and deal-terms will  likely show up in other dealings you have (strategic partners, M&A  transactions, etc.).

“2.  The Devil’s In  The Details:  Most entrepreneurs focus too much energy on the “obvious”  things like valuation.  Fact is, there are other, non-valuation terms in the VC  deal (vesting, stock option pool, liquidity preferences, etc.) that have a  significant impact on the economics of your deal.  It’s easy to lure yourself  into thinking you should solve for the highest valuation.  But, in most cases,  that’s sub-optimal.”

I would go even further: non-valuation terms are more important than valuation. Valuation is temporary, control is forever. If you don’t control your future, your current valuation is irrelevant.

Your current valuation is irrelevant if you are terminated and you lose all your unvested stock. Your current valuation is irrelevant if the board forces the company to raise a low-valuation Series B from existing investors by rejecting offers until the company is almost out of cash.

“3.  Great Advice Is  Hard To Find:  As it turns out, good advice in the VC business is hard  to find.  I would define good advice as a combination of competency (i.e. well  informed) and objective (i.e. non-conflicted).  You can get close sometimes (via  lawyers, advisors, etc.) but it’s really hard to find great  advice.”

The amount of advice on entrepreneurship on the Web is exploding. Some of it rocks. Some of it sucks. Advice is only as good as its source. Our source is me and Naval—we’re trying not to suck.

“4.  It’s Not Enough  To Be Smart: It’s important to remember that regardless of how smart you  are, VC negotiation is not just a matter of raw intelligence.  Sure, it helps to  have a few brain cells to understand the dynamics of a deal, but a lot is hidden  away in the dark corners that you only ever learn by doing it.  It’s also  important to remember that the VCs do this for a living.  Hopefully,  you don’t (you’re building businesses for a living).  You may be twice as smart  as they are, but you’re still at a disadvantage.  Try to even the playing field  as much as you can.”

"# I have a job offer at a startup am I getting a good deal Part 1 The offer

We’ve been answering this question a lot lately:

“I have a job offer at a startup, am I getting a good deal?”

This isn’t a comprehensive answer—just some questions we would ask if we had an offer.

If you don’t understand your offer, get a lawyer. But—right or wrong—most people don’t hire lawyers to review their offer letter.

The Offer (answers follow)

The Company (see Part 2)

The only good answers to this question are,

“Yes, an offer is on the way.”

and

“Let’s work out the major points and we’ll give you a written offer. We don’t want to start things off on the wrong foot with an offer that is way off the mark.”

Some companies pay more, some companies pay less, but an offer is fair if your compensation is in line with you peers’.

Your total compensation consists of salary, options, vesting, cliff, acceleration, bonuses, and severance. And a peer is someone who (1) joined the company at roughly the same time as you did (e.g. halfway between the Series A and Series B) and (2) has roughly the same title you do.

Most employees have a 4-year vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff, no acceleration, no bonuses, and no severance. The exceptions are for Vice-Presidents and higher (and founders).

By the way, your cliff may be longer than the company’s runway, but c’est la vie.

First you have to know how many options you have and how they vest. Let’s say you have 1000 options and they vest over 4 years. So you get 250 options a year for 4 years.

Now you have to guess what an acquirer would pay for your shares. Let’s call this the acquisition share price.  Setting the acquisition share price to the preferred share price of the last round is a good start—let’s say it was $1/share.

Now multiply your options (1000) by the acquisition share price ($1) to calculate the acquisition value of your options: $1000. Since the options vest over 4 years, the annualized acquisition value is $250/year. And while the acquisition value of your options might be $1000 today, you’re naturally hoping that the company’s acquisition share price increases over time.

If the company has gained a lot of value since the last round, you might set the acquisition share price higher than the preferred share price. If the company has not has not done well since the last round, you might set it lower. Either way, you will have to ask the company for the preferred share price in the last round.  Or if someone has offered to buy the company for $50M since the last round, I might use $50M to calculate an acquisition share price.

Finally, you will have to pay for your options—they’re not free. Options have a strike price—that’s what you pay for your options. Sometimes it’s much lower than the acquisition share price and can be ignored. Sometimes it’s high and can’t be ignored—high strike prices are becoming more common due to high-valuation rounds (Facebook), founder cash-outs, and high 409A valuations.

Most people think this number is important—it’s not. You care about the value of your options, not your percentage of the company. Your percentage will decline over time but the value of your options will hopefully increase.

Focus on the how many options you have and the acquisition share price (see question 3 above). Terms like percentage ownership and valuation can fool you.

This is for advanced Venture Hackers only. Don’t do this without an accountant and/or lawyer.

Exercise your options early if you want to start the clock on capital gains tax eligibility for your stock. Startup pros usually exercise their options early to lower the expected value of the taxes on their stock. In certain cases, you will pay less taxes in an acquisition or IPO if you exercise your options early.

Use an accountant or lawyer. Don’t sue us if this blows up in your face.

This post continues in Part 2.

"# Ideas need not apply

There were a lot of good comments on yesterday’s Do you know any idea investors? post. Here’s a few of them.

Michael Staton says:

“I’d say if you can’t bother to build it yourself, get potential customers lined up, build revenue on an easier offshoot, or convince someone else to build it in their spare time, then you should reevaluate whether you are an entrepreneur.”

Luca says:

“The idea is the easy part. If you are a first-time entrepreneur, try scaling down your concept to something whose value you can prove with friends & family money, then go to professional investors. If your idea does not lend itself to such an approach, try your hand first with something you can bootstrap.”

Ben says:

“An idea has a dollar value of $0. If you don’t believe in the idea enough to commit your cash/sweat equity to build it or a version of it to show it can work, why should friends, fools and family?”

"# Investors might share your plans with the competition

Rich Skrenta, a founder of Topix and the Open Directory Project, recently wrote about Spice Girls VC:

“So one day a few years ago I’m sitting in a VC’s office having a chat.  I had a few ideas rattling around in my head but the VC had his eyes on a then-current space which was hot.  He tossed a business plan for one of the leading startups into my lap.

  “Where’d you get this?” I asked.

“They gave it to me.” [A commenter suggests never sending decks to investors. At least write “Proprietary and confidential. Do not distribute,” on any collateral you send investors. And ask any recipients, in writing, via email, to kindly not distribute the deck outside their firm.]

“He went on to talk about how he wanted to launch a company into the space as well, and I’d be a great VP Engineering.  He said he knew a guy with some technology who could be CTO, had a VP Marketing in mind, and then we’d just need a world class CEO to round out the band.

“I formed a theory that the process of seeking VC ended up calling your own competitors into existence.  You’ll meet with many more VCs than the 1-2 who end up funding you. But after seeing a company or two get funded in your space, the VCs who passed or weren’t able to get in decide they want to have a bet in the space too.  Fortunately they have the benefit of having heard your pitch and the opportunity to personally grill you at length on your approach. [Compare to Farbood’s thoughts on the benefits of meeting VCs.]

“But doing the Spice Girls or N’ Sync thing to put a startup together can be tricky.  Startup founders can be so cranky/eccentric.”

Rich Skrenta’s blog is great (a few classics: 1, 2, 3). I would personally guess that the main source of startup competitors is market readiness, not Spice Girls startups.

"# Is it safe to send my deck to investors

“I know plenty of VCs that behave the way I do and plenty that don’t.”

— Brad Feld, on keeping decks to himself

Summary: A deck can help you get a meeting but it can also get in the hands of the competition. Whether you send a deck depends on who wants the meeting most. If you want the meeting more than they do, provide what they want. If they want the meeting more than you do, provide what you want. Finally, keep your secrets secret.

In What should I send investors?, we suggested sending investors a deck that describes your business plan. A reader subsequently emailed us and asked:

“Do I really want my business plan floating out there in venture land? What if it gets to my competitors? Is it safe to send my deck to investors?”

First, focus on executing your idea so you can make it public instead of focusing on how to keep it private. Second…

We can’t tell you whether you should send a deck. At times, we have sent decks and, at other times, we have avoided sending decks. There is no right answer but there are pros and cons that you can consider as you make your decision.

The pro is it might help you get a meeting.

The first con is it can lower the effectiveness of your electronic pitch. Sometimes less is more. If you’ve got a great elevator pitch and introduction, do you need to send a relatively long document filled with arguments that are better delivered in person?

The second con is…

Your deck probably won’t get in the hands of the competition, but you should assume it will.

An investor’s handwritten notes can also get in the hands of the competition. And if an “evil” investor cares enough about your company to email your deck to the competition, he cares enough about your company to schedule a meeting and take notes.

Whether you send a deck depends on who wants the meeting most. Use this simple test:

If you want the meeting more than they do, provide what they want.

If they want the meeting more than you do, provide what you want.

It all comes down to who has the most leverage—that’s it. And leverage comes from traction. Traction speaks louder than plans.



If you do send a deck, keep confidential things to yourself. In What should I send investors?, we wrote:

“Write “Proprietary and Confidential. Please do not distribute. Prepared for Blue Shirt Capital,” on the cover of your deck (some companies write it on every page). Investors are less likely to forward it if their name is on it. And ask any recipients, in writing, via email, to kindly not distribute the deck outside their firm.

“And if you must keep something absolutely confidential, don’t email it to investors and don’t mention it in person. Investors often look at several similar companies at once. Your plans probably won’t get to your competitors, but you should assume they will.”

Finally, you might want to try the private sharing feature on SlideShare. Please leave a comment if you do, we haven’t tried it yet.

"# It takes more than one intro to get a meeting

Don’t be afraid to get multiple intros to a single investor. Fred Wilson:

“One of my favorite VC quotes comes from Bill Kaiser of Greylock. He once said, “when I hear about a company once, I often ignore it, when I hear about it twice, I pay attention, when I hear about it for the third time, I take a meeting”.

“It happened to me this week. I met with Reshma who runs seedcamp, the european version of Y Combinator, on Monday and she told me about Zemanta which came out of last year’s seedcamp. Then I saw this blog post about Zemanta on Techmeme the next day. And then on Thursday, Alex Iskold, founder of our portfolio company Adaptive Blue, introduced us to Andraz, one of the founders of Zemanta.

“Three hits in one week is absolutely a “pay attention” notice. So this morning I am trying Zemanta out. The image and most of the links in this post were automatically provided by Zemanta.”

Put yourself in Fred’s shoes. His inbox is overflowing with intros to companies that are as good as yours. He has to ignore most of the intros and focus on a few of them. One of Fred’s best filters is the quality and quantity of the people referring your company. And, by the way, Fred went on to invest in Zemanta.

This is what we tell entrepreneurs who use AngelList and StartupList: we recommend doing all of these at the same time,

"# Just Say No VC terms that can really hurt Part 2

In Part 1, I discussed a few of the term sheet clauses that entrepreneurs should absolutely avoid; the wrong tradeoffs which later expose them to really “losing” their company. There are rational explanations for all of these, but, as we know, hell is paved with good intentions. Here are some more pathways to hell…

I am going to get some of my colleagues mad at me here. I see many stock options plans where, when employees leave the company, they have a short time window (usually 3 months) to exercise the options they have vested. This means they have to pay the strike price that the options were issued at and acquire the shares (strike price could be $3 for shares valued at $4 at the last round).

That forces startup employees to fork out cash and often crystallizes tax liabilities. It feels harsh to me. I think options should be exercisable over long periods of time, so people who have contributed to the wealth creation process can exercise when the value is realized (i.e. the company is sold) and it becomes a cash-less exercise for them.

Multiple liquidation preferences: This means investors get a multiple of their money back before you see anything. I don’t like these conceptually, they feel very un-venture to me, but they are only part of the deal. If you push super hard for a $100M valuation but have to accept multiple liquidation preferences as a trade-off, it’s your call. If the company goes public (at which point preferred shares convert into ordinary shares and the liquidation preferences disappear), you win. If the liquidation preferences are negotiated away in a subsequent round of financing, you win. Personally, I have a strong preference for simple terms at the right price from the outset.

Cumulative dividends: Sometimes an 8% dividend is slapped on, and it accrues over time when it isn’t paid. Again, this is not appropriate for most venture deals, but it may be part of an acceptable trade-off.

More than anything else, I find the real danger is complexity. When you need 3 full days of modeling to come to grips with a cap table, or when no-one can agree anymore on how clauses should be applied, you are in trouble. You will spend more time discussing internally how clauses should be applied than focusing on that critical acquisition you should be closing. I have seen cases where you needed robust macros to model outcomes. How about adding an exit-value-dependent management carve-out to a participating liquidation preference reverting linearly above 3X return on top of a French legal requirement that the first 10% gets distributed to all shareholders equally ? I have modeled this and it’s simply not worth it.

Value is not created by arcane legal language but by nailing business execution and growth. Keep it simple and keep yourself focused on the right elements.

I was at Seedcamp on the VC panel with Fred Wilson and a few others recently and there was a lot of talk about terms and how not to get screwed (evil evil VCs…). I will repeat the advice I gave then: you want to protect yourself adequately, get a good lawyer.  You will not out-compete us on terms negotiation. I use Tina Baker at Brown Rudnick in the UK and Karen Noel / Olivier Edwards at Morgan Lewis in Paris; they are great, go talk to them.

Having said that, it is completely your responsibility to understand what you are signing, and it is up to you to push back. Read the documents, ask questions about everything you do not understand. Ask your lawyer: where does this document create risk for me, both on my income stream and my ownership. How does this go wrong and how do I protect against it? This is advice you are seeking, not an outsourcing service.

And remember, there is no such thing as standard terms. May the force be with you.

"# Just Say No VC terms that can really hurt



If you believe the blogosphere chatter, the entrepreneur-VC relationship seems strained like at no time in the past.  The discussion seems to veer towards the “good versus evil” myth of creepy financiers intent on screwing polymath entrepreneurs out of their hard-earned wealth.  Good-versus-evil is not a very constructive way of framing complex debates (remember “the war on terror” and the “axis of evil”?).  Most sour VC-entrepreneurs relationships are simply partnerships gone bad, and divorce is never a pretty experience.

I see a lot of misguided commentary out there focused on the wrong issues, such as “how can you ask for liquidation preferences and call yourself entrepreneur friendly?”  I am happy to answer that one if you are interested.

What I wanted to do here instead is focus on a few of the clauses that entrepreneurs should absolutely avoid; the wrong tradeoffs which later expose them to really “losing” their company.  There are rational explanations for all of these, but as we know hell is paved with good intentions.  Here are some of the pathways to hell:

Anti-dilution says “your company has no tangible value and as result I accept 20% ownership today but if we don’t create value I want some protection on potential share price reduction”.  This protection is embodied in a clause called anti-dilution protection which results in additional “bonus” shares being issued where there is a down-round, i.e. a subsequent financing at a lower price per share.  You can attack this clause conceptually but if VCs did not have any form of anti-dilution they would set the initial price lower.  In other words, you as entrepreneur are getting less diluted today but with some ownership risk if company value goes down (at least that’s the theory, would be interesting to see how prices adjust without anti-dilution).

Anti-dilution is usually mild.  Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution says that a number of anti-dilution shares are issued (or the conversion price of the preference shares is adjusted) based on a formula nicely explained by Brad Feld back in 2005.

Here is how you can get really screwed: there is one version of anti-dilution whereby the number of shares issued to the investor is FULLY readjusted if subsequent financings are downrounds.  Say you raise $1M at $10 per share and hence issue 100,000 shares to your VC, in exchange for 10% of your company.  The next round is at $5 per share; the original VC now gets an additional 100,000 shares issued; in the original cap table, he now owns 20% of your business, before the new money comes in.

This gets nasty when serious money has been raised.  Imagine the following happens: the pre-money valuation on your next round is less than the cash you raised previously.  Say your company is in difficulty and raises $10M at $10M pre-money, having raised $10M previously.  Because the anti-dilution calculation is iterative,  guess what, the share price mathematically converges to… zero.  Legally it will be set at the par value, say €0.0001.

Your ownership just evaporated.

If your VC understands how the world works, you will sit around the table and hammer out some deal.  But your negotiating position is weak.  If on top of that a new CEO has been hired, the rational optimisation is to keep as much equity free for the new sheriff in town and not for the original entrepreneur.  You are now relying on people’s ethics, sense of fairness, or belief that long-term you don’t build venture firms by screwing entrepreneurs.  In, say, 75% of cases, good luck — few people really believe in win-win in these situations.

Note that there is usually a shared responsibility in full-ratchet: the entrepreneur is obsessed with maximising the headline number and accepts anti-dilution as a tradeoff (“OK, I will agree to this silly price but you better not screw up”).  Often a Pyrrhic victory.

First, let me state that reverse vesting matters to me.  I would not do a deal without some form of reverse vesting.  Here’s why: I invest in three founders, two of which work hard and one of which decides to leave to open a restaurant.  I (and his co-founders) are screwed.  The guy or girl who left gets a free ride on the back of everyone else.  He needs to be replaced, for which additional stock options are required.  This is why reverse vesting exists.

The usual reverse vesting that you will find in our term-sheet is: quarterly reverse vesting of founder stock over 4 years.  This is watered down or adapted based on individual circumstances.

I have seen cases where reverse vesting is not qualified: you leave the company, you lose your stock.  That is a very toxic clause, and you should never accept it.  You are now fire-able at will and there is even an economic incentive to do so.  Unfair and abusive.

So don’t find reverse vesting per se, but fight on the details.  Can a percentage of your stock be considered yours?  Probably.  Make sure there is a good leaver / bad leaver clause.  You get fired for cause, you lose some. You decide to leave, you lose some.  The company decides it does not want you around anymore, you keep it.  The need to be watchful of the details; sometimes you will be asked to sell your stock at “fair market value” when you leave, or at last round price etc.  Negotiate hard.

"# Keep your Series A options open if you raise debt

“[Our existing investors] had put in a right of first refusal. Since I was a young entrepreneur at the time, I didn’t understand that this basically meant that you couldn’t go to any other VC… We could not get a higher valuation because [our existing investors] wanted to put more money in the company themselves. So any time we would talk to another VC, they would talk him out of it: “This is not a good company, don’t worry about it.” So we were really stuck with [our existing investors] for the next round.”

– A Founder

Summary: Raising convertible debt from venture capitalists can restrict your Series A options and lower your Series A valuation—whether or not your investors have a right of first refusal on the Series A. You can keep your options open by raising debt from angels exclusively or raising debt from more than one VC.

Raising convertible debt from angels usually leaves your Series A options open. Why? Angels send a positive signal if they want to re-invest in the Series A, but they don’t send any negative signals to your prospective investors if they decide to pass. There are many simple reasons why an angel may not re-invest in the next round.

You need to be more careful if you raise convertible debt from a venture capital firm. They are more likely to ask for a right of first refusal with respect to some, or all, of the Series A. And, with or without a right of first refusal (ROFR), they can send signals that give them leverage and restrict your options in the Series A financing.

Let’s assume your existing debt investors, Blue Shirt Capital, have a right of first refusal on all of the Series A. You’re ready to raise your Series A and Blue Shirt says they want to re-invest. Other prospective Series A investors, such as Herd Mentality Management, will  have a standard reaction when they learn that your existing investors have a right of first refusal:



At worst, your prospective investors will decide not to waste their time with you, leaving you to take money from your existing investors at a low valuation.

At best, your prospective investors won’t give you an offer unless they are assured that they may co-invest with your existing investors. This forces you to raise money from two investors, implying that you will have to (1) raise more cash than you expected and (2) take 30%-40% dilution from two investors instead of 20%-30% dilution from one investor. Your prospective investors can also coordinate with your existing investors to drive down your valuation:



(Blue Shirt can use this same signal to drive down your valuation even if they have a right of first refusal on just a portion of the Series A.)

What if Blue Shirt says they don’t want to re-invest in the Series A at all—whether or not they have a right of first refusal? Herd Mentality will gag on their feed when they learn that your existing investors don’t want to re-invest:



At best, once there is no interest left in your Series A financing, Blue Shirt may tell you that they actually do want to invest in the Series A—at the right price. There’s no competition left, so you’re stuck with whatever Blue Shirt offers. However, this is an unlikely outcome since it’s not good for Blue Shirt’s reputation among investors.

More likely, Blue Shirt really doesn’t want to invest in the Series A and this negative signal makes it difficult or impossible for you to raise any more money.

If you raise convertible debt from a venture firm, you will have the same problems whether or not they have a right of first refusal:

Herd Mentality will still wonder whether they are wasting time since you already have investors on the “inside track”. They will still make an offer only if they are assured that they may co-invest with Blue Shirt. They will still coordinate with Blue Shirt to drive down your valuation. They will still gag if Blue Shirt doesn’t want to re-invest.


Your existing investors can send the same signals with or without a right of first refusal—the signals are simply stronger if they have the right of first refusal. This is a small taste of the game you will have to play when you raise a Series B and your prospective Series B investors interact with your existing Series A investors. Some solutions to this game are coming in a future hack.

For now, you can set up the seed round to avoid playing this game in the Series A.

First, try to remove the right of first refusal by applying the reciprocity norm:

“If you have a right to buy equity in our next round, shouldn’t we have a reciprocal right to sell you equity in the next round? In other words, why should you have a call option to buy the company’s equity if we don’t have a put option to sell you the company’s equity?

Why are we negotiating the next round of financing now? If we’re going to negotiate the next round now, we should negotiate all of the next round, not just your right to invest in it. I don’t want to do the next deal now, I want to do this deal now.”

If you lose this argument, try to contain the right of first refusal to a portion of the Series A. For example, if you raise money from three investors in the Series A, your debt investors would have the right to take up to one third of the Series A.

Overall, accepting a right of first refusal is a minor concession in your debt agreement. Don’t blow up the deal over this term since you will have the same problems whether or not you win this item.

If you decide to raise debt from venture capitalists, you should try to close two, three, or more venture firms.

As the number of insider investors increases, the influence of any one insider decreases. There is no single source with a single agenda that can send whatever signals it likes. Multiple investors will send multiple conflicting signals that outsiders will not be able to distinguish from noise.

And as the number of insider investors increases, the probability that one of them will send a positive signal increases. For example, at least one of your existing investors may state that they want to invest in your Series A.

You can also make the case to your prospective investors that you raised debt from multiple firms specifically to reduce their individual influence on the Series A:


“Raising debt from multiple VCs is our signal that these insiders are really no different than you. They know nothing more about the business than you do by now. The debt round was simply their opportunity to demonstrate their value to us.”

Finally, you can pit multiple firms against each other to get the best terms for the convertible debt:

Determine what terms Blue Shirt will offer to purchase the entire note. Then tell Herd Mentality that Blue Shirt wants to take the entire note at those terms. Would Herd Mentality consider a more favorable offer? Repeat. Finally, split the debt among all the investors.

"# Lawyers are referees not coaches

I learned a lot from a recent twitter by Andrew Chen:

“Other people teach you the rules of the game. Venture Hacks teaches you how to play it.”

First, I learned that lawyers are referees, not coaches.

Second, I learned that advisors are the coaches of the startup game.

Lawyers teach you the rules of the game. But they usually can’t teach you how to play it.

Lawyers say whether you can do something, within the confines of the law and your existing contracts. Lawyers will also write the contracts and do the filings. But they usually can’t tell you what to do—that’s what coaches do.

Here’s a classic startup mistake that illuminates the difference between a coach and a referee:

You’re negotiating an investment and you’ve agreed to a board with 2 investors, 2 common, and 1 independent.

You’re almost ready to sign the term sheet when your prospective investors say, “Sorry, we forgot, one of the common board seats needs to be the CEO.”

You’re thinking, “I’m the CEO and I was going to elect myself to the board anyway, so that’s fine.” Your lawyer agrees and says, “That’s standard.”

This is a mistake. If you hire a new CEO and he’s aligned with the investors, the investors will gain control of the board. Instead, you should create a new board seat for a new CEO.

A lawyer knows that you’re not breaking any laws or contracts if you give a common board seat to a new CEO. He also knows how to write the contract. But an advisor knows the possible outcomes of that decision.

Third, startups without advisors often assume their lawyers have good business advice. That’s a mistake. You need a coach, not a referee, to teach you how to play the game. And most referees aren’t good coaches (but some are).

Fourth, not every coach is a Phil Jackson. Not every coach has won 9 NBA titles as a coach. The effectiveness of coaches in the NBA varies widely. Why would the effectiveness of advisors be any different? Is your advisor a Phil Jackson?

Fifth, there’s more than one way to play the game. Phil Jackson doesn’t have a monopoly on coaching. And neither do we. Go find a coach who can teach you how to play the game. There’s only one Phil Jackson in the NBA because basketball is a zero-sum game. Fortunately, there’s more than one great startup advisor in the world—life is not a zero-sum game.

"# Lowering the water level Do bad economies spur innovation

“[Recessions] can cause people to think more about the effective use of their assets. In the good times, you can get a bit careless or not focused as much on efficiency. In bad times, you’re forced to see if there is a technology [that will help].”

– Craig Barrett, Chairman of Intel



Water hides the rocks at the bottom of the ocean. Lowering the water level exposes the rocks underneath.

In a great economy, money hides problems and opportunities. Companies will get orders whether or not they innovate. But in a bad economy, lowering the water level will expose new opportunities to our corporations.

Reduced spending will spur businesses to create products that even newly poor customers will buy. Products that customers truly need and value. Products with enduring value.

And businesses will create better ways of designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling the products customers already buy.

At a minimum, they will learn existing practices they ignored while the water level was high.

Constraints spur creativity. Bad economies demand it. Innovation is easier when the alternative is death.

“The Toyota production system was conceived and its implementation begun soon after World War II. But it did not begin to attract the attention of Japanese industry until the first oil crisis in the fall of 1973. Japanese managers, accustomed to inflation and a high growth rate, were suddenly confronted with zero growth and forced to handle production decreases. It was during this economic emergency that they first noticed the results Toyota was achieving with its relentless pursuit of the elimination of waste. They then began to tackle the problem of introducing the system into their own workplaces… Prior to the oil crisis, when I talked to people about Toyota’s manufacturing technology and production system, I found little interest.”

Suzanne Dingwall Williams is publishing M&A hacks on her excellent blog, Venture Law Lines. She call the series: ‘Selling the Startup’,

Selling the Startup: Can you sell your subscriber base?

“Recently, a new client received a very favourable takeover offer for her business, including its subscriber base. Problem: the privacy policy did not permit her to provide the account information for her subscriber base to the acquirer. Same thing with the user license: it was non-transferable. We had to go back and rectify the matter in a ponderous way before closing.”

 Selling the Startup: Providing Price Protection in the Term Sheet

“As a general rule, [M&A] term sheets provide for price adjustment based on revenues and a closing balance sheet, and based on the results of the buyer’s due diligence (this is really a price reduction clause, as no one ever finishes due diligence and concludes “By God, they’re really onto something here. Raise the price!”). Here are three other areas where you, as seller, need to consider providing for some price protection…”

A couple more gems from her excellent blog:

On Being An “Off the Grid” Startup

“The reality is that 95% or more of North American startups are created outside of Silicon Valley. Many are created in fairly robust business generation centres such as Boston, and emerging centres such as Chicago and Raleigh-Durham. Just as many are created in regions where the startup infrastructure is small or non-existent. Do the practices, deal terms, and operational decisions typically made by startups in the overheated Valley, with its cadre of serial entrepreneurs and super-angels, have any application for the rest of us, who are off the Silicon Valley grid?”

If Venture Capital is Dead [in Canada], What’s Next?

“Venture capital in Canada is no longer an industry, but a financial product offered by only a handful of players…

“When someone finally says this, I’ll agree. But I’ll also say that, as someone who advises entrepreneurs,  I don’t particularly care. All this tells me is that companies will now use different financial tools to feed growth, using business plans that are not shoehorned into the somewhat artificial venture capital model for growth—i.e., in and out in 3-7 years.”

"# Make a new board seat for a new CEO

“Because we weren’t having success finding a CEO, [our investors] insisted that we hire these managers [a temporary CEO and CFO]. That didn’t go great.”

 – Tim Brady, 1st employee at Yahoo, Founders at Work

Summary: Create a new board seat for a new CEO. Don’t give him one of the common seats.

Whether you negotiate a proportional or investor-leaning board, your term sheet will probably state that the CEO of the company must fill one of the common board seats. This may seem reasonable. One of the founders is probably the CEO and you were going to elect him to the board anyway.

Don’t accept this term. The investors are looking several moves ahead of you.

If you accept this term and hire a new CEO, he will take one of the common seats. The common shareholders will not have the right to elect that seat. If the new CEO turns out to be aligned with the investors, the new coalition of CEO + investors will control the board of directors.

A new CEO will probably be a professional manager who does a lot more business with VCs than he is likely to do with you.

VCs regularly refer the CEO to promising companies. They let him co-invest in their startups. They let him invest in their venture funds. They determine his compensation in your company. Where do you think the CEO’s loyalties lie?


Most likely, a new CEO will be aligned with the investors.

A coalition of a new CEO + investors can hurt the company, founders, and employees. Consider this scenario:


The company needs to raise a Series B. Your investors discourage the new CEO from shopping around for cash because they want to invest more money in the business at a low valuation. Your investors tell you not to spend time raising cash because they will put in more money: “You should focus on building the business.” You want to shop around and raise money at a high valuation but the CEO does a half-arsed job because he knows this game.

The company ends up doing the Series B with its existing investors because that is the best offer on the table. A few months later, the CEO’s shares are “right-sized” and he is happy (“We have to pay the CEO market rate, right?”). The investors have put in more money at a low valuation and they are happy. The founders and employees have been diluted and they are wondering what just happened.

This story is not unheard of in Silicon Valley.

A new CEO can develop an antagonistic relationship with the company’s founders. Founders, like everyone else, have inadequacies as leaders and managers. Their inadequacies are usually worse than the ones the company portrayed while it was recruiting and selling the new CEO.


The new CEO joins the company and naturally blames the founders for all of the existing problems in the business. Who else is there to blame? Like any new leader, he continues to blame his predecessor for the next 12 months and loses any sympathy he had for the founders. He convinces himself that he deserves more equity for his contributions even if it dilutes the founders and employees.

“These fucking founders,” he tells the investors.

“Yes, these fucking founders,” say the investors.

And on they go to find to find a mutually beneficial opportunity to right-size the CEO.

These two tales of CEO-investor intrigue illustrate why a new CEO is not necessarily your friend on the board of directors. If and when you hire a new CEO, create a new board seat for him. The common board seats should always be elected by the common shareholders.

For example, adding a CEO seat to an investor-leaning board with two investors yields


2 common  + 2 investors + 1 independent + 1 CEO = 6 seats

The same scenario with one investor yields


1 common + 1 investor + 1 independent + 1 CEO = 4 seats

If you want to keep an odd number of people on the board, add another independent seat too.

If you have a good BATNA,  you should reject any proposal where the CEO takes one of the common board seats.

Your investors may argue that the new CEO seat tips the board in favor of the common stockholders since the CEO holds common stock.

If only you were so lucky.

If your investors accept the premise that the new CEO is probably aligned with them, the new seat actually tips the board in their favor. If they don’t accept this premise, they are still wrong.

First, the independent director holds common stock, but the investors do not consider his seat to tip the board in favor of the common stockholders. You should ask your investors to consistently apply the same reasoning to the new CEO seat.

Second, the CEO does not represent the common stockholders on the board; his job is to create value for all classes of stock. In fact, all of the board members have a duty to serve the interests of the company, not a duty to “serve their class of stock”.

You learn a lot about an investor’s attitude toward directorship  if they imply that they represent their class of stock on the board. Investors should protect their class of stock through protective provisions, not through their board seat.

"# Make your debt attractive to investors

Summary: Seed investors often argue that debt doesn’t incent them to (1) help the business and (2) increase the share price of the eventual Series A. Actually, (1) debt does incent investors to help the business and (2) equity may also incent investors to decrease the Series A share price. That said, you can make your debt much more attractive to investors with a few concessions.

Although convertible debt is often the best choice for a seed round, investors often argue that debt does not incent them to contribute to the business:



Your response to an investor’s claim that “(1) debt doesn’t incent me to help the business”:

“If you buy $100K of debt, you get $100K worth of shares in the Series A, plus some shares for your discount. You’re not losing money by contributing to the business—the Series A share price may go up but your share value remains $100K, plus a discount.

“And… as you contribute to the business, the company’s risk goes down, opportunity goes up, and the net present value of your debt goes up. You’re still incented to help the business when you buy debt.”

That said, equity incents an investor even more. If an investor buys $100K of equity in the seed round and locks in his share price, he makes a paper profit if the share price increases in the Series A.

Note to entrepreneur: You don’t need to make this argument on your investor’s behalf.

Your response to an investor’s claim that “(2) debt doesn’t incent me to increase the eventual share price of the Series A”.

Rational investors are 

(We’ll explain how the math works in the comments.)

Some seed stage funds maintain or decrease their percent ownership in the Series A. These funds tend to focus on seed stage companies.

Other seed investors try to increase their percent ownership in the Series A—if the company is doing well. These funds tend to invest in most stages of a company’s growth.

Ask your investors about their track record and strategy for follow-on investments. If they like to increase their percent ownership in their best investments, they have an incentive to drive down your Series A valuation whether they buy debt or equity in the seed round.

Rather than debating the finer points of your investor’s incentives, you can make your debt much more attractive to investors with a few concessions (ordered from small to large):

"# Marc Andreessen on cognitive bias

In The Psychology of Entrepreneurial Misjudgment, part 1: Biases 1-6, Marc Andreessen kindly interprets an essay from Charlie Munger‘s book, Poor Charlie’s Almanack:

“Mr. Munger’s magnum opus speech, included in the book, is The Psychology of Human Misjudgment — an exposition of 25 key forms of human behavior that lead to misjudgment and error, derived from Mr. Munger’s 60 years of business experience. Think of it as a practitioner’s summary of human psychology and behavioral economics as observed in the real world.

“In this series of blog posts, I will walk through all 25 of the biases Mr. Munger identifies, and then adapt them for the modern entrepreneur. In each case I will start with relevant excerpts of Mr. Munger’s speech, and then after that add my own thoughts.”

I started making a cheat sheet of Marc and Charlie’s key points—I thought I would share it with you. It’s a handy reference once you’ve read the full article.

(For another great article on cognitive bias, see Cognitive biases potentially affecting judgment of global risks.)

Once you realize how much incentives influence human behaviour, you need to assume their influence is even bigger than you think. Never think about something else when you should be thinking about incentives.

“If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason.”

– Benjamin Franklin

Incentives are so powerful that every incentive should have a counter-incentive to restrict gaming of the first incentive.

Liking and loving something conditions you to (1) ignore faults of and comply with wishes of the loved, (2) favor people, products, and actions associated with the loved, and (3) distort other facts to facilitate love.

Wanting to be liked by your teammates impedes you from firing people and making unpopular but good decisions.

Disliking or hating something conditions you to (1) ignore virtues in the disliked, (2) dislike people, products, and actions associated with the disliked, and (3) distort other facts to facilitate hatred.

Startups should focus on their customers, not their competition—whom they may dislike.

Execution is often better than further contemplation:

“A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.”

— George Patton

Believing that something will happen, and convincing others that it will be so, makes it more likely to happen.

While a hypothesis is still doubted, wise entrepreneurs know whether (1) persistence and iteration will prove the hypothesis, or (2) the hypothesis will not be proven and additional testing is a destructive waste of time—a new hypothesis is required.

"# More diligence and less capital coming for startups and their investors

In my first post, A brief history of your investors (and their investors), I wrote about the history of venture capital. I described how the economy and stock market drives investments into venture capital and startups. I also covered how the basic incentive structures are affected by these drivers.

I ended with a suggestion that cash is gaining power relative to other assets and a suggestion that this will shift the balance of valuation and terms in favor of the root sources of capital (limited partners and above). In this second part, I’ll discuss why I think this is happening and what it means for venture investors and entrepreneurs.

The coming decade is not going to be a bull like the 1980’s or 1990’s. Why is this important? Because it’s going to turn money into a “scarce” commodity and therefore drive down valuations, erode returns, remove under-performing venture funds, and reduce company exit valuations.

The 1980’s and 90’s were incredibly bullish. The annualized return from the public stock market was 16.8% from 1982-2000. That is huge. If you dive into the 16.8%, the fundamental return was 9.9% annualized.

What’s the remainder? I’ll call it speculative return. The speculative return was 6.9% between 1982-2000. And what is speculative return? It’s the expansion of the starting and ending P/E from 1982 to 2000. We started 1982 with a P/E of 8.0 and finished 2000 at 26.4!

As I wrote in part one, the increased supply of money drove these large returns. M3 money supply started its ballistic rise in the early 1980s. The total debt market went from $4T in 1980 to about $52T at the end of 2009. So the credit boom and decreasing interest rates fire-hosed cash into all markets. And that’s how a speculative return of 6.9% a year was driven. Other drivers included the baby boomer demographic, the technology boom, geopolitical stability, and the boom in international trade from globalization.

If we look back in time, the preceding time period of 1966 to 1981 had a total return of 5.9% (including dividends of course). However, the fundamental return was 11.1% and the speculative return was -5.2%! We started 1966 with a P/E of 17.8 and finished 1981 with a P/E of 8.0. And to add a little more color, the 1950-1965 post-WWII time period had a total return of 16.1%. That was comprised of a 10.0% fundamental return and a 6.1% speculative return. And, looking forward a bit, we can see the 2001-2005 time period had a total return of -1.3% with a -6.9% speculative return.

This data suggests that the speculative return component is a huge driver on total returns. And that it has a fairly long half-cycle time. It’s in the vicinity of 16-18 years if we do the analysis since the early 1900s. In a short 5 year period, speculative return can comprise 55% of the total return. And, over a 40 year period, speculative return drops to near 0%.

Benjamin Graham said it best when he said that the stock market worked like a voting machine, but in the long term like a weighing machine. If you are building a long term company, that is the good news. The not-so-good news is that the short term pain of being part of the voting machine could be very significant.

Okay, its 2010. Could the speculative return dynamics since 2001 have ended? Umm — probably not. Take a look at this table of important drivers that compare 1981 (the start of the mega 20 year bull period) to now.

To me, these are very sobering statistics. They paint a completely different picture than at the start of the last bull cycle of 1982-2000. My judgment is that these statistics are going to seriously suppress speculative return. The -6.9% of 2001-2005 will get worse and total returns will suffer. In 2021, statistics will show that the 2001-2020 time period had good fundamental returns. But horrific speculative returns.

What will this mean for the U.S. entrepreneurs and investors? In short, we are not going to be “partying like its 1999” for quite awhile. (Who knew that the artist formerly known as Prince could forecast market peaks?)

The implications of negative speculative returns will be huge. The number of venture firms and their personnel will shrink. And probably hit bottom sometime this decade. Venture firms will be under significant pressure to outperform their peers and outperform their limited partners’ common benchmark indices like NASDAQ. Limited partners will feel the same type of pressure as they too source their capital from sources that will be under tremendous economic pressures. Angel firms (translation: angels who are institutionally backed) will feel the same pressure. Angel investors (individuals investing their own capital) will become more risk averse.

How will these pressures affect entrepreneurs? As a whole, valuations will stay suppressed and will probably come down further over the future years. Revenue multiples and “discount to public market multiples” will re-enter and dominate the late stage financing lexicon. Early stage companies will also feel this suppression with smaller venture rounds. Capital-intense startups that need to raise large initial Series A financing rounds will be particularly affected.

The amount of time spent in due diligence will go up and get more rigorous and detailed. Of course, there will always be companies that are exceptions. But as a rule, the suppressed return environment will force all parts of the money chain to spend way more time in diligence. Way more time and energy for limited partners to raise capital. And the same for venture investors. And the same for angel firms.

Startups will feel this diligence pressure next as they are the next stop on the money supply chain. My guess is that new service providers will emerge to help both investors and entrepreneurs with these diligence processes. How they will be paid is an open question.

Since individual angels use their own cash, they won’t be directly affected. But they will probably diversify their portfolio by making smaller investments on average. And put less of their total portfolio in startups so that they can have greater portfolio liquidity. In aggregate, they will put less money into startups.

Okay, so valuations down and diligence up for every part of the money supply chain. We can all work through that.

Where matters are going to get tricky is that parts of the money supply chain will disappear. A venture investor or angel firm may run out of cash in a fund and need to raise a new fund. A startup company has a similar problem.

If you are a startup company, a pure non-dilutable asset is your time. Raising a new financing round requires time. Since we’ve already established that investor due diligence time will increase, the last thing an entrepreneur will want to do is spend that time talking with investors who don’t have cash to invest. Or who can only invest with particularly harsh terms because of their own liquidity needs.

In the next and final part of this series, I will detail the questions you should ask your potential investors. These questions will assist you in ensuring you are talking to the right investors for your company.

In closing, here’s the “New York Daily Investment News” front page from the early part of the Great Depression to remind us that history may not repeat exactly. But it does rhyme.

"# My experiments in lean pricing

What you charge for your product is simultaneously one of the most complicated and most important things to get right. Not only does your pricing model keep you in business, it also signals your branding and positioning. And it’s harder to iterate on pricing than other elements of your business. Once you set a price, coming down is usually easier than going up.

Most people choose to defer the “pricing question” because they don’t think they (or the product) are ready. Something I hear a lot is that a minimum viable product is by definition (embarrassingly) minimal. How can you possibly charge for it?

A minimal product is not synonymous with a half-baked or buggy product. If you’ve followed a customer development process, your MVP should address the top 3 problems customers have identified as important and it should do it well. You can ensure that by dedicating 80% of your efforts to improving existing features versus cranking out new ones.

Steve Blank bakes price exploration right into the initial customer interviews. Price, like everything else, is built on a set of hypotheses that needs to be tested early. Steve suggests you ask potential customers if they’d use the service for free. This is to gauge if the product’s value proposition is compelling at all. You then ask if they’d use the service for $X/yr. How do you come up X? You can simply roll the dice and adjust along the way, or use Neil Davidson’s excellent guide to software pricing to start with a more educated guess.  Once your MVP is built, Steve asks you to sell it to your early customers. There is no clearer customer validation than a sale.

Sean Ellis, on the other hand, argues that achieving initial user gratification (product/market fit) is the first thing that matters and suggests keeping price out of the equation so as not to create unnecessary friction:

“I think that it is easier to evolve toward product/market fit without a business model in place (users are free to try everything without worrying about price). As soon as you have enough users saying they would be very disappointed without your product, then it is critical to quickly implement a business model. And it will be much easier to map the business model to user perceived value.”

Both Steve and Sean advocate removing price from the equation — but at different points. Steve removes price during the customer discovery process but suggests you charge for your MVP. Sean removes price from the MVP and suggests you charge after product/market fit. I can see the merits of both approaches and wondered which was right for my product: CloudFire: Photo and Video Sharing for Busy Parents.

On the surface, freemium seems like the best of both worlds: Get users to try your service without worrying about price, then up-sell them into the right premium plan later. However, many people make the mistake of giving away too much under the free plan, which leads to low or no conversions. It’s human nature — we all want to be liked.

More important, we don’t yet have enough information to know how to price or segment the feature set. I made this mistake with my first product, BoxCloud: an early visionary customer called me up and said, “I really like your product and want to pay for it but your pricing doesn’t require it.” After a few more iterations of segmenting the feature set, I decided to forgo the free plan and simply offered premium plans with a trial period. Sales went up and so did the quality of feedback, which I attribute to the difference between feedback from customers versus users.

(Hiten Shah shared a similar story with me around his experience with Crazy Egg. Even 37signals has greatly deemphasized their free plans to almost being fine print on their pricing pages.)

Lincoln Murphy just published a timely white paper on “The Reality of Freemium in SaaS” which covers many important aspects to weigh when considering Freemium, such as the concept of quid pro quo where even free users have to give something back. In services with high network effects, participation is enough. But most businesses don’t have high enough network effects and wrongly chase users versus customers. What I particularly liked in this paper is Lincoln’s recongition that “Freemium is a marketing tactic, not a business model.”

I strongly feel that, especially for SaaS products, starting with free and figuring out premium later (all too common) is backwards. If you know you are going to be charging for your product, start by validating if anyone will pay first. There is no better success metric and it leads to less waste in the    long run. Focusing on the premium part of freemium first lets you really learn about your unique value proposition — the stuff that will get you paid. You can then come back and intelligently offer a free plan (if you still want to) with more intelligence and the right success metrics clearly defined. Even if you think you have a one-dimensional pricing plan like I did (e.g. number of projects), you’d be better served testing it with paying users because pricing experiments take a much bigger toll than other types of experiments.

How did I put all this to test? The biggest mind shift in following a lean startup process is going from thinking you know something to testing everything you think you know.

So I followed Steve Blank’s advice and built some pricing questions into my initial face-to-face customer interviews. Because CloudFire is a re-segmented product in an existing market, potential customers referred to competitor pricing. This had to be balanced against the perceived value of our unique value proposition – saving time with faster and easier sharing of lots of photos and videos. Through these interviews I determined that, like their sharing needs, my potential customers valued simple hassle-free pricing and $49/year for unlimited photo and video sharing was a fair price they were willing to pay. That is what I charged them once my MVP was ready.

I wanted to run the same set of pricing tests with web visitors that I did during my interviews. Short of split testing a free and paid version of the MVP, which is technically illegal (update) and unfair to paying customers, I decided to split-test 3 different products with 3 different prices:

All plans have a 14-day free trial with the exception of the free plan which is free forever. Here are the variations I tested:

Original: Single unlimited plan

This is the simple option I discovered during customer discovery interviews. It served as the control.



Variation 2: Multiple plans

I segmented the product into 2 offerings: unlimited photos+video and unlimited photos only. I wanted to test price sensitivity and gauge interest in video sharing. Not many people I interviewed were currently taking lots of videos but they all wanted to be taking more.



Variation 3: Freemium

This has the 2 plans from above along with a limited free plan. Yes, this is a freemium plan. I wanted to measure if a limited free plan would disproportionately drive the right type of traffic (busy parents in my case).



Variation 4: No Price During Introductory Period

I added a fourth variation to test Sean Ellis’ advice on removing price till product/market fit, but I tested this differently. I was not comfortable offering the full product for a price and for free at the same time. So rather than including this page with my A/B tests, I instead tested it with new parents I interviewed.



First Place: The original single plan — second place in conversions and best overall performer. Surprisingly, the original page was the best overall performer.

Second Place: Variation 3: Freemium – most conversions but second place overall. Not surprisingly, the freemium variation drove the most conversions but only outperformed the original by 12% and had the lowest retention. Referral stats combined with random polling/emailing revealed a majority of the users that signed up were just curious (and not parents).

Third Place: Variation 2: Multiple plans – least conversions and worst overall performer. People reacted least favorably to the two paid plans.

Non-starter: Variation 4: No price during introductory period. Parents I interviewed did not understand the introductory period without explanation and were reluctant to try the service without knowing how much the service was going to cost. Probing further, they weren’t willing to invest the time building up web galleries and inviting others only to find that the service might be priced out of their expectation.

It does pay to align pricing with your overall positioning. Our unique value proposition is built around being “hassle-free and simple” and people seemed to expect that in the pricing model as well. A lot of our existing customers were already paying for their existing sharing service so the leap from free to paid was not a big one. While Sean suggests removing price before fit for consumer facing products, he suggests always charging for enterprise customers to gain their commitment. This is another case where pricing needs to be explicit. Using Cindy Alvarez’s model, our customers appear to be Time-Poor, Cash-Rich. Offering no-hassle free trials was sufficient to remove the commitment risk. Money back guarantees might be another way to further lower this risk.

The biggest lesson learned, though, is how accurate my initial customer interview findings were, compared to all the hypotheses that followed. Pricing is more art than science and your mileage will vary, but whenever possible get out of the building, talk to a customer, and consider testing price sooner rather than later.

What do you think? Why do you think these variations finished the way they did? What other variations would you like to see us try? How else do you think we could increase conversions? I’m looking forward to discussing your responses in the comments.

"# Not so Scary terms in offer letters

Offer letters are short and easy to read, as far as legal documents go. But they contain some seemingly scary terms that are (1) ubiquitous in Silicon Valley and (2) usually “no big deal”.

We’re not saying that no one has ever gotten into a conflict or lawsuit over these terms—just that it isn’t common. The offer letters from the major Silicon Valley law firms are very consistent.

Here are the seemingly scary terms from an offer letter I got from Yokum Taku at Wilson Sonsini. As always, this is not legal advice.

“If you decide to join the Company, it will be recommended at the first meeting of the Company’s Board of Directors following your start date that the Company grant you an option to purchase X shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a price per share equal to the fair market value per share of the Common Stock on the date of grant, as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors.”

You don’t get your options until the board grants them at the next board meeting. But they should start vesting on your start date.

The strike price is equal to the fair market value as of the grant date (sometime after the next board meeting). But that probably won’t be higher than the FMV as of your first day of work.

“This option grant shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Company’s Stock Option Plan and Stock Option Agreement.”

These are big documents that you’re agreeing to without seeing. If you’re concerned, request copies before you sign your employment offer.

We’ve never seen anyone negotiate exceptions to these documents. Just make sure the company doesn’t have a right to repurchase your vested stock.

“Moreover, you agree that, during the term of your employment with the Company, you will not engage in any other employment, occupation, consulting or other business activity directly related to the business in which the Company is now involved or becomes involved during the term of your employment, nor will you engage in any other activities that conflict with your obligations to the Company.”

The company isn’t forbidding you to work on your own business on the side.

Get a lawyer to advise you on what you need to do to own your side business. At a minimum, work on the side business on your own time and don’t use anything owned by the company.

“As a condition of your employment, you are also required to sign and comply with an Invention Assignment Agreement (enclosed) which requires, among other provisions, the assignment of patent rights to any invention made during your employment at the Company.”

These Invention Assignment Agreements always seem too far-reaching but they’re rarely negotiated, especially if they’re coming from one of the major Silicon Valley law firms.

The Invention Assignment Agreement usually asks employees to carve out the IP they developed before joining the company by listing it in an exhibit. If you’ve developed a lot of IP that is relevant to the business, you might want to ask the company to list its IP instead of, or in addition to, yours.

“You should be aware that your employment with the Company is for no specified period and constitutes at-will employment. As a result, you are free to resign at any time, for any reason or for no reason. Similarly, the Company is free to conclude its employment relationship with you at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice.”

This is an offer letter, not a 5-year contract with the Chicago Bulls.

“You should note that the Company may modify job titles, salaries and benefits from time to time as it deems necessary.”

You have no job security.

“This offer of employment will terminate if it is not accepted, signed and returned by such-and-such date.”

This offer expires soon.

“This letter, along with any agreements relating to proprietary rights between you and the Company, set forth the terms of your employment with the Company and supersede any prior representations or agreements including, but not limited to, any representations made during your recruitment, interviews or pre-employment negotiations, whether written or oral.”

If it isn’t in this agreement, it isn’t happening, even if we told you it was.

"# Potpourri Introductions Auctions Tranches and CoInvestors

Summary: Angels make more introductions than VCs because angels need co-investors. You can’t clear the market in series–you can only clear it in parallel. Tranches are dumb–they have zero upside and catastrophic downside. Two investors aren’t always better than one. Finally, a ‘very special’ message to graduating Y Combinator founders: don’t do deals on D-Day and feel free ping us if you want additional help.

Adam Smith from Xobni, a Y Combinator company, calculates that angels made 5 times as many intros as VC investors while Xobni was raising a Series A:

“We spoke with 16 angels and 12 VCs. Angels made 24 introductions; VCs only made four. The average angel introduced us to 1.5 other investors, but the average VC only introduced us to 0.33 other investors. That’s a 5x difference!

“So angels can be helpful even if you’re raising a mostly VC round.”

Read the rest of his great letter to graduating Y Combinator (YC) companies: Raising Money, Some Data and Tactical Advice.

First, angels usually take a small piece of a Seed or Series A. If they like the company, they need to make introductions because they need co-investors. VCs usually don’t want or need co-investors–if they like a company, they want to buy as much as they can.

Second, some angels are followers, not leaders. They find a company they like but they don’t want to lead the investment. So they introduce you to a top-tier firm like Blue Shirt Capital and say to themselves,

“If Blue Shirt wants to invest, the company must be good. Plus, Blue Shirt will do all the work, and I’ll go along for the ride. I know Blue Shirt won’t cut me out since I introduced them to the company—firms that cut out the middleman stop getting intros.”

Adam writes:

“Our series A didn’t happen quickly. We excited the people we met with, but we were timid about getting started having recently closed a $100k angel round. One firm had interest, so we thought “We better talk to someone else to make sure we’re getting a good deal.” That incremental approach went on for a few months. We were always in late stages with one investor but just beginning the dialogue with another. Deciding to raise money should be an atomic decision; don’t try to just dip your toe in.”

You can’t clear the market in series. You have to do it in parallel. You can’t create an auction by meeting investors one-at-a-time.  The only way to get a market clearing price is to meet a lot of investors at once.

On eBay, everybody bids at the same time, over a short and arbitrary period of time. That drives the price up. They don’t bid one-at-a-time over a timespan of  ‘whenever’.

As for how to create an auction, here’s the short version:

Jump on your desk, kick your laptop across the room and declare a start to your fund-raising; set up 10 investor meetings for the same week; you will probably end up meeting only 4-6 of them due to scheduling conflicts; tell them “We plan to sign a term sheet in 6 weeks, if we don’t have an offer by then, we’re going back to using sweat equity to build the company“; signal your valuation by saying “We want to raise $X from n investors with no more than Y% dilution, including the option pool,” (Y = 15%-25% per investor plus a 10%-20% option pool dilution). In a tight process with VCs, there are three meetings; one with the original partner you were introduced to; next, you meet the original partner with a few other partners; finally, you go to a partner’s meeting; there may also be an intermediate meeting where some of the partners come to your office to refactor your code and eat your food; if some investors are being slow while others are moving along, tell the slow ones, “By the way, we are on second meetings with three funds.” If things go well, you should receive 2-3 term sheets; reject the ones that explode the next day: “We told other investors that they have until the end of the week to send us term sheets, we can’t break our promise.” Negotiate the offers over the next 2-3 days and get your favorite investor to the terms you want. During closing, keep your other prospective investors warm in case the deal blows up; but don’t break any binding no-shop or non-disclosure agreements in the process.

(We’ll elaborate in a future hack; with apologies to Paul Graham.)

Auctions and artificial deadlines create a positive feedback loop of social proof (“Other people want to invest, don’t you?”) and scarcity (“Hurry up or the deal is going to disappear”). That’s what closes deals. Auctions also force you to fail or succeed in a few weeks. Either way, you will soon get back to creating value for your customers.

Finally, don’t use the a-word (‘auction’) when you’re raising money. Investors don’t like it. Auctions are “taboo” when you’re selling part of your company to an investor, yet perfectly dandy when you’re selling your whole company to an acquirer. Don’t say, “We’re running an auction to get the best deal”, say “We’re looking for the right partner to help build our business.”

Adam writes:

“Traunching is bad for the company. If your investors exercise the traunche(s) then it means that the company is now worth more than they’re paying you, so you’re leaving value on the table. You might want to raise a smaller round and go to the market again when your valuation is higher.”

Tranches are generally stupid. They have zero upside and catastrophic downside.

At best, tranches give your current investors a right to invest at yesterday’s valuation if your company is doing well. If your company is doing poorly, your investors will figure out how to get out of their obligation to invest. The tranches will probably have material adverse change clauses that allow your investors to get out of their obligation. Almost all tranches are call options for the investors, not put options for the company.

If your investors back out of a second tranche, you will need to figure out how to manage the negative signal that your current investors don’t want to invest in your company, even at yesterday’s valuation. Remember the Golden Rule:

“He who has the gold rules.”

Get the gold while you can. If your prospective investor wants tranches, say:

“Currently, we’re focused on raising this round, not the next one. Let’s negotiate the next round at the next round.”

We disagree with one claim in Adam’s article:

“… you want to have more than one major investor. If one firm is out of line then the other firm will be there to say “This is unreasonable”. You’ll get more varied inputs. Having more than one major investor means you’ll take a little more dilution, but I think it’s worthwhile.”

Yes and no. There are good arguments for bringing on one or two investors. We don’t have a strong opinion either way.

If you have two investors, you can play them off each other during closing if one of them is being slow or demanding, you can split them on the board so one of them votes your way, you can split them when they vote their protective provisions, et cetera.

But, the additional dilution of two investors is usually significant, about 10%-15%. And you don’t need two investors to remove the unreasonable terms that Adam wants to avoid, you can just run an auction:

“We have an offer that doesn’t include [egregious term X]. I hope there is some flexibility on your side because I would really like to work with you but I have a fiduciary duty to our shareholders.”

It’s easier to remove unreasonable terms when investors are fighting to win a deal–they’re more likely to collude if they’re co-investing.

Me: Dude, we should offer to help the Y Combinator companies with their term sheets.

Naval: Don’t we already have a blog for that?

Me: Yes, I’m sure both of our readers are well educated by now.

Naval: It doesn’t matter anyway… the good YC companies will get snatched up on demo day–savvy investors will force quick decisions.

Me: What’s the rush? The YC founders should spend a week to get multiple offers. Good investors compete with their merits, not exploding offers.

Naval: Why are you telling me? Get the word out…

"# Primo essay on team building

Go read Steve Newcomb’s essay on building teams:

Cult Creation

Steve’s the founder of Powerset. This essay is very long and very good. It’s the best article I’ve read on building teams. And team building is 10x more difficult, tedious, and important than raising money.

I love/hate this essay.

I love the fact that Steve is open sourcing his secrets. I hate the fact that high-quality startup advice is the exception and not the norm.

I love that this essay was written in Silicon Valley. I hate that Silicon Valley dominates the world in quality startup advice.

Here’s a sample from Steve’s essay:

Engineers Suck at Negotiating, so Don’t Negotiate, Be Fair –from me, after being pissed off about hiring practices I experienced from bad founders.

Over the years, I have noticed  some sort of weird inverse correlation between the talent an engineer has for coding and their ability to negotiate. I’ve seen people that could have hacked into NSA suddenly shit twinkies the second I bring up the topic of their salary.  I don’t exactly get it, but it’s there.

Founders, on the other hand, are almost by nature programmed to negotiate everything.  In some cases, I have seen founders take advantage of engineers who don’t negotiate well, or who simply hate to negotiate so much that it’s a near-phobic experience.

DO NOT DO THIS! If you do, you’re an ass-hat.

Besides being unfair and a dick move, it is also stupid and even worse yet in my book – it’s illogical.

What inevitably happens is that the engineers, who all have different deals, get drunk one night.  Then the shit hits the fan when they tell each other what they all make and what equity they got.  Come Monday morning, every engineer’s password is “my_founder_is_a_dick,” several viruses and backdoors are suddenly installed into the code base, and the founder gets the silent treatment – none the wiser of his impending doom.  Way to go ass-hat!

If you can’t tell, this one pushes my buttons.  I don’t give a frog’s fat ass how good a negotiator an engineer is when I’m interviewing them.  I want them to have such pristine code that it makes my other engineers cry.  I want them to have a beautiful mind that can use logic and reason to solve the engineering challenges that I hand them.  It is completely irrelevant how good they are at negotiating.

Sequoia’s presentation offers a lot of good advice with typical insight, simplicity, and clarity. Here are a couple thoughts on their presentation.

Don’t take Sequoia’s (or anyone’s) predictions about the future too seriously. If they’re smart enough to predict the future, they should have done it before the downturn.

In good times and bad, startups should be asking themselves the same questions:

When it seems easy to extend your runway (good times), companies operate with shorter runways, they run experiments that are less likely to work, that have higher value outcomes when they do work, and they run them longer:

Let’s chase market share until we have 3 months of cash left so we can raise money at a high valuation and let’s hope capital will be available then.

When it seems hard to extend your runway (bad times), companies operate with longer runways, they run experiments that are more likely to work, that have lower value outcomes when they do work, and they run them for shorter periods of time:

Let’s raise money right now even though our valuation won’t be optimal, and if that doesn’t close in 2 months, let’s cut our burn and chase customers.

Here’s a table that summarizes the difference between good times and bad times:

For some, Sequoia’s advice is good advice anytime. These people like to run their business as if it’s always hard to extend their runway.

Others (contrarians) will ignore Sequoia’s advice. They will take big risks and run their business as if it’s easy to extend their runway.

There’s nothing inherently right or wrong with either approach. Choosing a runway strategy is part of the CEO’s job description.

But our observations match Sequoia’s advice: startups that survived the last downturn ended up doing OK. They didn’t take life-threatening risks with their runway—survival mattered more than market domination.

"# Should I give my lawyers equity

Summary: When lawyers defer their legal fees, they expect equity for the risk of not getting paid. If their risk is low or they’re not deferring fees, you can say no. In any case, offer them the right to invest $25K-$50K in your financing instead of giving them free equity.

A reader asks:

“I wonder if I could pester you briefly for lawyer advice. We are talking to a law firm and I’ve got their standard letter of engagement which asks for the right to purchase 1% of common stock at the same price as founders. Their other terms seem reasonable but this term seems pretty tough. What do you think?”

This is a common ‘ask’ by lawyers.

It’s also an example of a negotiation axiom: you get what you ask for. Particularly when one side is relatively clueless about industry norms, the other side’s strategy is to ask and expect their clueless opponent to say yes.



If your lawyers are not deferring their legal fees, you should just say no. You’re already paying them for their services, right?

If your lawyers are deferring their legal fees, they can ask for whatever they like: equity, backrubs, your car, whatever. They want compensation for the risk of never getting paid. That’s fair.

But if your financing is imminent or nearly certain, the risk of not getting paid is low and you can still say no. Or give them the minimum equity you would give an advisor: roughly .1% vesting monthly over 1-2 years with no cliff.

Most law firms spread the equity to (1) just the partners or (2) across the entire firm. In either case, the partner on your case receives nearly zero equity and the associate who does all the work receives even less.

Unless you hire a one-man law firm, equity doesn’t incent lawyers to work on your case.

In any case, if your lawyers ask for a piece of the business, you can offer them the right to invest $25K-$50K in your financing instead—don’t give them the equity for free. They get equity, you get money.

This unfortunately incents your lawyers to drive down the share price of your financing, but this conflict of interest is small relative to their existing conflicts of interest:

Most law firms do a lot more business with VCs than they’re likely to do with you. VCs hire law firms. VCs refer new clients to law firms. Lawyers make money by executing transactions and your investors simply provide more transactions than you do.

So don’t sweat this minor conflict of interest.

"# Should I pay my investors legal fees

“C’mon—you have $500M and I am raising $1.5M and you want me to take the first $25K to pay your legal expenses for doing the deal? That’s like your dad giving you your allowance and then asking you to buy him a hot dog. When we were raising money for Flixster I thought that must be a trick—like if I agreed to that term they would pull the term sheet at the last second and say I failed the secret fiscal responsibility test.”

Summary: Venture capitalists don’t want to pay their legal fees for financings. Don’t fight this term—that’s a “big move on a little issue.” Instead, cap your contribution to the investor’s legal bill. And watch the legal bills in small financings: don’t spend a large portion of the investment on lawyers or give up a lot of equity for the privilege of paying your investor’s legal bill.

Venture capitalists don’t want to pay their legal fees for financings. We explain why in the appendix below.

So startups often pay their investor’s legal fee. An investor gives you money, you use some of the money to pay his lawyer, and the investor buys a little bit of your company with his legal bill!



Although paying your investor’s legal fee may fall outside the bounds of common sense, don’t try to remove this term. It’s an industry norm.

Norms are made to be broken, but this one isn’t worth it. You will do a lot of work to win this argument and you will gain very little. “Make big moves on your little issues and little moves on your big issues,” writes G. Richard Shell in Bargaining for Advantage. This is a little issue.

Also consider your investor’s perspective. In every other financing, their investee paid the fund’s legal fee. Are you really going to ask your investor to go to his partnership and say, “Hey, this deal is going to cost us $50K in cash money.”

When you pay your investor’s legal bill, you’re paying their lawyers to negotiate against you. You’re paying their lawyers to make your deal worse.

You may have to pay your investor’s legal bill but you certainly don’t need to keep paying their lawyers until they run out of things to say. Put a cap on your contribution.

Without a cap, their lawyers will just keep arguing and collecting fees. With a cap, they’ll stop arguing once they hit the limit.

Propose a cap between $10K-$20K and let them make the case for a higher limit. Some investments require more legal work and some require less: in one rare case, we saw a top-tier investor do a large Series A financings ($10M) with no external counsel at all.

Many caps include the fees for both sides, i.e. the company shall pay no more than $X for the sum of the investor’s and company’s legal fees. It makes more sense to cap only your investor’s legal fee… but hey! this is venture capital, not math camp.

Don’t spend $20K on lawyers if you’re raising $50K. Not only are you spending a lot of the investment on lawyers, but you’re giving up a significant chunk of equity for the privilege of paying your investor’s legal bill. Investors recognize this issue and usually pay their own legal bills in debt financings.

If the investor’s expected legal bill is a large percentage of the investment, you could increase the investment to cover the bill and increase your pre-money to cancel out the dilution from the extra money. This makes sense but it’s also a “big move on a little issue.”

Instead, calculate your effective pre-money and do an apples-to-apples comparison to your alternatives. For example, if you raise $50K on a $50K pre-money and spend $10K of the investment on your investor’s legal fee, your effective pre-money is only $40K since your investor bought half the company and you got $40K. In general,

effective pre-money = pre-money × (investment – investor’s legal) ÷ investment

This is similar to calculating your effective pre-money in the option pool shuffle.

Many people think investors don’t want to pay their legal bills because the money would come out of the investors’ own pockets. The argument goes like this: VCs pay their salaries from the fund’s management fee and if they had to spend the management fee on legal bills, they would have to reduce their salaries.

But investors already pay various expenses such as ongoing legal fees or accounting fees without touching their management fee.

And there are good reasons why investors and their limited partners may not want to pay legal fees out of the management fee: (1) legal fees are a variable expense so it’s hard to include them in a budget that justifies the management fee to limited partners, and (2) limited partners don’t want investors to feel like they’re taking money out of their own pockets to do legal diligence.

(Of course, all these issues are irrelevant for investors who are investing their own money.)

We don’t know how or why this became the norm, but there are several advantages and few disadvantages for the investor whose investee pays the legal bills. Paying the investor’s legal bill:

"# Should I raise debt or equity

Summary: If you raise convertible debt for a seed round, you should negotiate simple and short documents, close quickly and cheaply, and maintain your options for the Series A. But first, determine if you should raise debt or equity—debt is better for small financings with small discounts.

Startups often raise their seed round by selling convertible debt instead of equity because debt is simpler and cheaper. Read Yokum Taku’s excellent  series on convertible debt for a primer.

Seed stage convertible debt agreements are fairly simple, especially if your investors are angels. There isn’t a lot to hack in these agreements. You should be more careful if your debt investors are VCs, but these debt financings are still much easier to negotiate than an equity financing.

Later stage convertible debt can get complicated and adversarial. We know companies that took convertible debt from a corporate investor and couldn’t pay the debt back on time—which triggered the corporate investor’s right to take over the company. Fun stuff.

If you are raising convertible debt, you should focus on negotiating simple and short documents, closing quickly and cheaply, and maintaining your options for the Series A. But first…

Let’s say your seed investors purchase debt with a 20% discount off the Series A share price. If you eventually sell shares in the Series A for $1 each, the seed investors will convert their debt to equity for $0.80/share.

Now, let’s say your seed investors are willing to buy equity for $0.90/share instead of buying debt. Should you sell debt or equity?



You should sell debt only if you can use the money to increase today’s share price by over 25% before the Series A financing. Otherwise, sell equity.

In this example, debt is worthwhile if you think you can sell Series A shares for over $0.90/share  × 125% = $1.125/share.

Let’s say you decide to sell debt in your seed round and you raise a Series A at $2/share. After applying a 20% discount, your debt investors pay $1.60/share for their Series A shares. You were wise to sell debt to your seed investors in the seed round instead of selling them equity for $0.90/share.

But if you raise a Series A at $1/share, your debt investors pay $0.80/share for their Series A shares. You should have taken their offer to buy equity at $0.90/share in the seed round.

In general, you should sell debt only if you think it will increase your share price over

today’s market price for your shares ÷ (1 – discount).

If you are raising a typical seed round, say $50K-$500K, you probably want to sell debt instead of equity. If you raise enough seed debt to last 6-12 months, you should have enough time to increase your valuation by the 25%-100% required to overcome typical discounts of 20%-50%.

For example, if you raise $250K in a seed round in return for 15% of your equity, your seed round pre-money valuation will be $1.42M. You should raise debt instead if you expect your Series A pre-money valuation to be at least

$1.42M ÷ (1 – .2) = $1.77M (in the case of a 20% discount)

or

$1.42M ÷ (1 – .5) = $2.83M (in the case of a 50% discount).

In general, if you don’t think you can increase your share price and valuation by 2 to 3 times in every round of financing from Series A to Series C, you should probably pack up and go home. In fact, the company’s share price typically increases the most from the seed round to the Series A as the business goes from nothingness to product, users, or revenue.

If you are raising a large seed round, say $1M, you may want to sell equity instead of debt.

For example, if you raise $1M in a seed round in return for 15% of your equity, your seed round pre-money valuation will be $5.67M. But if you raise $1M in return for debt at a 25% discount, your Series A pre-money will have to be at least

$5.67M ÷ (1 – .25) = $7.56M

for the debt to be worthwhile. $1M of seed financing may not take your Series A valuation above $7.56M—you may want to sell equity instead of debt in the seed round.

"# Should I sell my company or raise capital



Q: Should I sell my company or raise capital and go for it?

Sell if it dramatically changes the lives of the founders and the early team. Every dollar after your “fuck you money” is icing—get your financial independence first and make the icing at your next company. You can also use an earn-out at the acquirer to capture some of the potential upside of raising money.

If you raise capital, you risk your current value for a chance to capture your future value. Is there a difference between capturing future value at your current company and your next company? You can create future value at your next company after you’ve captured your current value and done your time at the acquirer.

Also consider selling if you are at a local maximum, e.g. your company or market is going sideways and the company will be worth less before it is worth more. Of course, smart buyers will wonder if they should be buying when insiders are selling.

One alternative to an acquisition is to cash-out some of the founder’s shares so they’re wealthy enough to feel comfortable with the risk of building a bigger business. I’m guessing the Facebook founders have been cashed-out to some degree.

Q: What does it take to be a successful entrepreneur?

Successful entrepreneurs delight their customers, execute relentlessly, and enjoy lots of luck. You recognize great entrepreneurs when you see them (like porn) and you get better at recognizing them every day.

Q: What does it take to be a successful investor?

To be an investor, you need access to capital. There is no IQ test.

To be a successful investor, you also need great dealflow, good judgement in picking companies, and, in competitive markets, the competitive advantage to win deals.

Note: These excellent questions are adapted from Ashkan Karbasfrooshans’s Venture Hacks interview.

"# Should I shop around

“We took the approach of wanting to get to know the different partners and the different possibilities and to see where there was the best fit. Partnerships take a lot of work—you want to go out on a few dates before you get married. Yes, we dated a few people but didn’t get married… and so there were a few unhappy girlfriends out there. The choice wasn’t an economic choice, it was a customer choice.”

— Steve Jobs

Summary:  A deal is only as good as its best alternative. Keep improving your alternatives until you have a signed term sheet. And keep developing your current offers or they will die. Finally, don’t say “shopping around”, it puts investors off their stroke.

A reader asks:

“I have spoken to only one person regarding an investment, and they immediately said they would back my company. Should I contact more than one potential investor, i.e. shop around for someone who has experience in this space, and might be capable of injecting more capital for bigger goals? The product looks good, so I’m confident I can successfully engage other potential investors.”

In your mother’s womb, you learned that a chain is as strong as its weakest link. Now, in the awesome womb of Venture Hacks, you learn that,

 A deal is as good as its best alternative.

Receiving a term sheet is a significant milestone. Receiving a verbal offer or an indication of interest is also a significant milestone.

But you should keep engaging alternative investors until you sign a term sheet. Sometimes, you should keep engaging alternative investors until you close (assuming the term sheet you signed doesn’t have a no-shop).



Create a market that is filled with alternative buyers. Without alternatives, you will be stuck in a hostage negotiation with a single prospective investor. With alternatives, you will do well. In Bargaining for Advantage, G. Richard Shell writes,

“Research has shown that, with leverage, even an average negotiator will do pretty well while, without leverage, only highly skilled bargainers achieve their goals.”

Spending time developing alternatives is as good as spending time developing your current offer. It increases the chances of closing your current offer. It closes your current offer faster. And it improves the terms of your current offer. Keep this in mind if you “don’t have time” to develop alternatives.

Keep developing your current and pending term sheets while you engage alternative investors. If you sit on a term sheet for 2+ weeks, there’s a good chance, say 33%-50%, that the offer will disappear because the investor will move on to a shiny new company and his enthusiasm for your company will wane. Not to mention that most term sheets expire after a couple weeks.

Don’t let offers cool while while you warm up alternatives. Shopping around for Gucci underwear is effective as long as stores have it in stock. It’s not effective if each store runs out of inventory while you’re visiting its competitors.

The best way to keep investors warm is to focus on fund-raising so you can (1) get all your offers at once and (2) pick the best one before any of them cool down.

When you receive your first offer, you can buy 1-2 weeks of time by saying,

“We’ve promised to close out conversations with a few investors and we need to honor our promise.”

“We’ve committed to a partner’s meeting next week and we need to honor our commitment.”

No investor is going to ask you to break your previous commitments. This little tactic buys you time and increases your social proof and scarcity.

How do you know if you’ve cleared the market? You need two or three offers from investors who make it a habit to invest in startups at your stage. These investors should create enough demand, social proof, and scarcity among themselves to improve your terms and clear the market.

Finally, receiving more than two or three offers means you will have to disappoint more investors. Turning down investors is surprisingly hard.

Finally, don’t use the words “shopping around” or “auction” with investors. Their reaction to these terms is,

 “What am I, a bag of money? I can only get in this deal if I pay the most?”

You’re not “shopping around”, you’re “looking for the right partner”. While you’re talking to investors, you can define the right partner in terms of domain experience, or someone who wants to invest more/less money, or someone who has a history of backing the founders, or anything but: the guy who will pay the most.

"# Startup Lessons Learned



Go read Eric Ries’ new blog: Startup Lessons Learned. He’s a Venture Advisor at KPCB and a co-founder, CTO, and VPE of IMVU.

Eric blogs about one of my favorite topics: applying lean/agile to startups. Lean thinking is the number one thing you can do to make your startup more effective. His post on A new version of the Joel Test is a great place to start…

On board meetings:

“At IMVU, we opened up our board meetings to the whole company, and invited all of our advisers to boot. Sometimes it put some serious heat on the management team, but it was well worth it because everyone walked out of that room feeling at a visceral level the challenges the company faced.”

On solitary programmers:

“It’s not true that energized programmers primarily do solitary work; certainly that’s not true of the great agile teams I’ve known. Instead, teams should have their own space, under their control, with the tools they need to do the job.”

On schedules:

“Agile team-building practices make scheduling per se much less important. In many startup situations, ask yourself “Do I really need to accurately know when this project will be done?” When the answer is no, we can cancel all the effort that goes into building schedules and focus on making progress evident. Everyone will be able to see how much of the product is done vs undone, and see the finish line either coming closer or receding into the distance. When it’s receding, we rescope.”

On QA:

“Imagine a world where your QA team never, ever worries about bug regressions. They just don’t happen. All of their time is dedicated to finding novel reproduction paths for tricky issues. That’s possible now, and it means that the historical ratio of QA to engineering is going to have to change (on the other hand, QA is now a lot more interesting of a job).”

"# Steve Jobs does customer development No new features



In Steve Jobs does customer development, I asked readers to find a customer development lesson in Steve’s interview. There were a lot of good responses that I didn’t anticipate. But Reece came closest to the answer I was looking for:

“The subtler customer development point from Jobs is ‘We don’t need to add new stuff.’ He realized the feature set is fine — instead of cramming in new features that most users won’t touch, Apple can instead focus on positioning the product via marketing and pricing.”

In other words, Apple didn’t add a camera so they could deliver on their positioning (“lowest-cost way to the App Store”), increase market share (“everyone can afford it”), and maybe even increase revenue.

I think Reece made one small, important error; so let’s pick on him for the sake of our education.

Reece implies that a camera is a feature “that most users won’t touch.” But adding a camera is probably a good idea. Maybe it’s the key to selling a billion more iPods. Who knows for sure?

Go to any group meeting at any startup and you’ll hear employees arguing for their own camera: “but if we just add feature X we’ll get more customers.” That’s a reasonable hypothesis. More people might buy the product with feature X. Should you build feature X?

Not necessarily. A startup’s cash-on-hand is shrinking every day. You want to add the features that will do the most to stop your losses. You don’t execute every random idea without prioritizing it.

The optimal plan may be to slow down product development, commit more resources to customer development, and find the right positioning for your product. The lesson here:

Once you reach a certain level of product/market fit, the best plan may be to add  no new features, focus on positioning, make more money, and move up the startup pyramid — even though the team has a million obviously great ideas for new features that will make a buttload of money. You can improve the business without improving the product.

Can you find other examples where  Apple and Pixar did customer development?

"# Steve Jobs does customer development



Steve Jobs is the ultimate visionary. He has a vision, he implements it, and the world pays him tens of billions of dollars for it. He doesn’t ask customers what they want because they would ask for a faster horse, not a car. He knows what customers want before the customers do. He is the quintessent entrepreneur — the ideal that every founder strives to become.

Right? Wrong.

Even Steve Jobs does customer development:

David Pogue: “You put a camcorder on the iPod Nano. Why not on the iPod Touch?

Steve Jobs: “Originally, we weren’t exactly sure how to market the Touch. Was it an iPhone without the phone? Was it a pocket computer? What happened was, what customers told us was, they started to see it as a game machine. Because a lot of the games were free on the store. Customers started to tell us, “You don’t know what you’ve got here — it’s a great game machine, with the multitouch screen, the accelerometer, and so on.”

“We started to market it that way, and it just took off. And now what we really see is it’s the lowest-cost way to the App Store, and that’s the big draw. So what we were focused on is just reducing the price to $199. We don’t need to add new stuff — we need to get the price down where everyone can afford it.”

(From Q&A: Steve Jobs Snipes at Amazon, Praises Ice Cream)

Apple has changed the positioning of the iPod Touch twice. First, it was a multitouch iPod. Then it was a “game machine”. Now it’s the “lowest-cost way to the App Store.”

Refining the product’s positioning is the second step in Sean Ellis’ Startup Pyramid:

“Once you have achieved product/market fit, it’s time to accelerate through the next steps of the pyramid and then begin scaling your business. Here’s a brief description of what to do at each of the steps before scaling:

“Promise: Highlight the benefits [positioning] described by your ‘must have’ users (those that say they would be very disappointed without your product).”

In this step, you use a combination of surveys and interviews to talk to your customers and ask questions like “In your opinion, what is the best reason for using our product?” If they say the best reason is playing games, start testing that positioning with new customers and see if it performs better than your current positioning.

In Four Steps to the Epiphany (page 111), Steve Blank developed a model for positioning products based on market type:

“Existing Market: Compare your product to your competitors. Describe how some feature or attribute of the product is better, faster — an incremental improvement.

“New Market: It’s too early for customers to understand what your product’s features will do for them. Instead, describe the problem your product will solve and the benefits that the customers will get from solving it — a transformational improvement.

“Resegmented Market: Compare your product to your competitors. If it’s low cost, describe price and feature set. If a niche, describe how some feature or attribute of the product solves the problem your customer has in a way comparable products do not. Describe the benefits that the customers will get from solving their problem this new way.”

The iPod was initially positioned in a resegmented market — it was a multitouch iPod. Then it was positioned in an existing market — portable game players. Now it’s positioned in a new market: a way to the App Store (although Steve Jobs probably should have said “pocket computer” instead of “way to the App Store” — pocket computer is the new copy at apple.com).

If Apple wants to create a new market of devices that access the App Store, they’ll have to educate prospective customers who don’t know what the App Store is — or why they would want to access it. New markets always require customer education. Fortunately, Apple has been bombarding us with “there’s an app for that” ads for some time now.

Jobs makes a second, subtler, point about customer development in the quote above. Can you find it? The best correct answer gets a shout-out in our next post.

The lender chooses between these two options at the time of sale. This term simulates the liquidation preference of preferred stock. You can use the same valuation that you negotiated in the microhack above.

If you are raising $500K in debt, you should reserve the right to use the same documents to conduct subsequent closings up to some cap, say an additional $250K of debt.

Many debt agreements don’t require you to get the current lender’s permission to raise more debt in the future. But it is better if your current debt investors clearly understand this possibility. And it will be cheaper if you can use the same documents to close the additional debt.

The company and a majority of the lenders should be able to amend the debt agreement and make the changes binding upon the other lenders. This is much easier than getting agreement from every single debt investor.

Examples of amendments include changing the date that the debt matures or the size of a qualified financing.

This term is especially useful if one of your angels is inexperienced or malicious. Without this term, he may try to negotiate a better deal when you request the amendment.

"# Supersize your vesting with these microhacks

Our previous vesting hacks have discussed getting vested for time served, acceleration upon termination, and acceleration upon a sale. This article is a collection of four vesting microhacks you can use to supersize your vesting.

A terminated co-founder’s unvested shares are typically cancelled. The resulting reverse dilution benefits the founders, employees, and investors ratably.

Instead of canceling the shares, divide them among the remaining co-founders and employees ratably. You should argue that,

“Cancelling a terminated co-founders shares puts a lot of pre-money into the investor’s pocket. Those shares should be distributed among the founders and employees who created that pre-money valuation.”

This argument will carry more water if you offer to put a portion of the reclaimed shares into the option pool to hire a replacement for the co-founder.

Reclaiming a terminated co-founder’s shares does not create an incentive for co-founders to terminate each other. Co-founders have an incentive to terminate each other even if the shares are cancelled. In our experience, this incentive is never a factor. Founders are almost always allowed to vest in peace unless they are incompetent, actively harmful, or clash with a new CEO.

Some option plans provide the company the right to repurchase your vested stock upon your departure. The purchase price is ‘fair market value’. Guess whether the definition of fair market value is favorable to you or the company…



Founders and employees should not agree to this provision under any circumstances. Read your option plan carefully.

(Props to Suzie Dingwall Williams who already brought up this microhack in the comments.)

If you are having trouble applying any of the other vesting hacks, trade those chips in for six months of acceleration upon hiring a new CEO. Investors are usually eager to bring in “professional” management. They should agree to this term because it aligns your interests with theirs.

If you have a lot of leverage, you may be able to negotiate an agreement to keep vesting if you are terminated but retained as a consultant or a board member. For example, the company may terminate you but keep you as a consultant to help decipher your spaghetti code.

Some companies have been known to sneak this term into their closing documents. We’re not big fans of that approach.

Again, if you are having trouble applying any of the other vesting hacks, you may be able to trade those chips in for this one.

"# Take guidance from VCs not orders

There is a behavior I witness in some first-time CEOs that I meet, not necessarily the younger and more mavericky generation, that I do not think is necessary, nor helpful. It’s an insidious but frequent tendency to let the board decide, rather than advise or approve. It goes like this…

Because VCs have blocking rights on some important decisions (approving the budget, your compensation, raising money), they are often able to wield way more power than their 20% ownership would suggest they should have. As a result, entrepreneurs often talk of coming to the board with their slides in hand, asking “what does the board want me to do?”, which is code-speak for, “I am here to ask for permission from my investors to do what I need to do.”

Entrepreneurs will present the strategy they believe in, but essentially allow the board (read: the investors) to walk straight through the carefully thought-out action plan and redesign the entire strategy in one swell meeting. The investor probably walks away feeling like he provided value and the entrepreneur now goes back to his team to explain that his investors puked over the team’s strategy and that the priorities have changed.

That may be the product of investor behavior, but I would argue this is the CEO’s fault. Nature abhors a leadership vacuum, and VCs will fill that gap if you don’t.

If you really believe in what you are doing, you come to the board telling board members what you are planning to do, taking considered advice on whether this is the right strategy, considering that advice and executing on what is, in your best judgment, the right path for the business. That’s what you are there to do. Make decisions fast, don’t fall for analysis-paralysis, trust your gut, execute and iterate. As Tim Ferriss would say, ask for forgiveness, not permission.

Guy Kawasaki does lists all the time and it seems to work for him so I thought I would try one too: Here are the top five lighthearted reasons why VCs should not drive your strategy:

You want to leverage your board and you don’t want to get fired for being a solo player either. Personally I really like what my partner Jeff refers to as a culture of “champion and challenge”. I guess you have to be born in the USA to say phrases like that, but it’s spot on. If I really disagree with a strategy decision, trust me, we will have a serious discussion about it. But come and champion what you believe in, take ownership, step into the role. Ultimately, I backed you because I believe in you, and you know better.

"# Term Sheet Hacks Get a Great Deal

“Having information that the other side doesn’t have gives [VCs] an advantage… they take advantage of entrepreneurs who haven’t been through this before… they were totally willing to take advantage of us.”

– Mitch Kapor, Founders at Work

“Knowledge is Power.”

– Sir Francis Bacon

In this series of articles, we’re going to explain how to negotiate a great deal with your Series A investors. We’re calling this series Term Sheet Hacks.

You, the entrepreneur, negotiate a term sheet once every few years. You negotiate your most important term sheet (the Series A) when you have the least experience. You negotiate against a VC firm that issues two to three term sheets per month. You negotiate against a “standard” term sheet that encapsulates decades of combined knowledge from hundreds of venture firms.

Like a good chess player, your prospective investors know what the game looks like many moves from now:

On the other hand, you probably have a basic understanding of a few simple terms like ‘valuation’ and ‘vesting schedules’. You barely know what the game looks like right now, let alone at the Series C.


Your investors can take their time – they have years to invest their money – but you’re under pressure from your employees and co-founders to deliver the money that will keep your company alive. The clock is ticking…
Good companies get bad deals all the time.
Many of the successful companies that we all read about in the news didn’t negotiate good deals simply because they didn’t get good advice. Consider  Jim Clark‘s (founder of SGI and Netscape) account in The New New Thing:
 “At [SGI] board meetings… Jim’s face would get red and he’d start shouting that [an investor and board member] had cheated him and his engineers.”

Or ask a friend who has taken money from investors.
Whether these stories are true is irrelevant. Like any negotiator, your prospective investors are not in the business of giving you a good deal. They are in the business of making money for themselves and their investors (their limited partners).
Isn’t this what my lawyers are for?
In principle: yes. In practice: no.
With few exceptions, most law firms advise their clients to accept “standard” terms.
Most law firms do a lot more business with VCs than they are likely to do with you. VCs refer new clients to the law firms, hire the law firms regularly, and know the attorneys socially. Where do you think the law firms’ loyalty lies?
The basic incentives between you, your law firm, and your prospective investors are  not in your favor. Your lawyers make money by executing transactions and your investors simply bring more transactions to your lawyers than you do.
You can’t hack a term sheet without leverage.
Don’t bother trying to apply any of these term sheet hacks if you don’t have leverage.  You can’t negotiate at all without leverage. Roughly speaking, leverage is power.

Alternatives are the most basic type of leverage in any negotiation. Fancy negotiators call their best alternative a BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). If you’re negotiating a term sheet with the famous Blue Shirt Capital, your BATNA may be an independent term sheet from the renegade Herd Mentality Management.
A BATNA is just one type of leverage and it is possible to negotiate effectively without a good BATNA. Hostage negotiators do it all the time. But if you’re not in the mood for a hostage negotiation, get multiple offers before you apply any of these hacks. Don’t let anyone tell you that creating competition to invest in your business is a bad thing.
Let’s get this party started.
Our goal here is to give you the knowledge to effectively negotiate against the experts. We don’t have all the answers but we’ve negotiated enough term sheets, started enough companies, and learned from enough entrepreneurs, lawyers, and VCs to understand how this game can play out. Term Sheet Hacks is a work in progress and we’re looking forward to learning more from your comments and emails.
These articles assume that you either have a term sheet in-hand or are anticipating one. If you need a basic understanding of term sheets, read Brad Feld’s term sheet series and hire a lawyer.

"# Term sheet tuneup

I recently received an email from an entrepreneur who had questions about a term sheet he received. Here are his questions and my answers.

The entrepreneur says,

“The investors are in the process of closing a fund so they want to give us a bridge loan now and do the Series A later in a few months after they’ve closed their fund.”

VC firms make seed investments all the time. If you have alternatives, take money from a firm that actually has the capital to invest in a Series A.

Even if the firm has capital, you won’t be able to raise a Series A from anyone if the bridge firm doesn’t like your progress after the bridge.

Read this article from our archives: Keep your Series A options open if you raise debt.

“The board consists of 2 investors, 1 independent, 1 CEO, and 1 founder.”

This is too heavy for a bridge or a Series A. I recommend 1 investor, 2 founders for the bridge. Worst case: 1 investor, 1 founder, 1 independent. Best case: 0 investors, 2 founders. Use this quote from Marc Andreessen as normative leverage:

“In many cases, we don’t even think today’s raw startups should have boards.”

He’s talking about seed stage companies like you.

For the Series A, the worst case is 2 investors, 1 independent, 2 founders, 1 CEO (if and when we hire one). Read these articles:   Create a board that reflects the ownership of the company, Make a new board seat for a new CEO, and Control is a one way street.

“What are you seeing for valuations nowadays? Our prospective investor tells me ‘market’ is 40-40-20 (founders, investors, option pool) after the Series A.”

Market is whatever the market says, not what one investor says. You need at least two competing offers to create a market. If you have only have one offer, you’re going to have a tough time negotiating — although it can be done and companies do it all the time.

I would strive for 70 – 20 – 10 (founders, investors, option pool), depending on how much you’re raising. The more you raise, the greater your dilution. And I would settle for 60-25-15. These goals will be dramatically easier if you only have one investor in your Series A syndicate.

Read these articles: Create a market for your shares, Tips from a ex-VC who helps entrepreneurs raise money, and Should I shop around?.

“The investors want to replace the CEO during the Series A.”

This is a big red flag, especially if you aren’t interested in giving up the CEO spot right now. Fred Wilson says it well in The Human Piece Of The Venture Equation:

“I’ve learned that nothing can replace the entrepreneur’s passion and vision for the product and the company. If you rip that out of the company too early, you’ll lose your investment. I think it’s best to wait until the initial product has succeeded in obtaining a critical mass of users and a business model has been developed that works and make sense for the business and is scaling. Then, if its warranted, you can sit down and have the conversation about bringing in experienced management.”

Use this quote as normative leverage.

This doesn’t mean you can’t collaborate with your investors to find a new CEO if you think the company needs one. Ask for references from all of the founding CEOs they’ve replaced — including the bad references. Fred Wilson also has a great post on how to bring in a new CEO: I baked the cake, you can ice it, but don’t screw it up.

Finally, who are the investors? If the investors are a well-known firm, they’re probably trying to anchor you and there’s a lot of room to negotiate.

But if the investors are from an unknown firm, they might think this is a fair deal. They might have the mindset that they’re investing in an asset that’s going to be “managed” by the founders or new management. That’s not the way startups work. If the founders give up too much of the company too early, they lose their drive to create value for the common and preferred shareholders alike.

"# Terminating Ciscos founders

Don Valentine from Sequoia Capital and Cisco’s founders, Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner, discuss Len and Sandy’s termination in this rare video: (Update: Google took the video down. Thank you universe. There are still some choice quotes below. If anyone has a copy of the video online or a transcript, please email us at nandn@venturehacks.com.)



We don’t know the actual facts of the matter and we don’t care who is “right”. The lesson here is that, right or wrong, you don’t want to look back and feel the way Len and Sandy do (except for the many millions they made).

There is no such thing as a “bad” deal as long as you understand the deal’s pros, cons, and possible outcomes. But Len and Sandy, by their own admission, did not. We’ll discuss how to avoid Len and Sandy’s fate in an upcoming hack. Knowledge is power.

Some interesting quotes from the video:

“Len and I were not [savvy].” – Sandy Lerner video→

“I would strongly advise anybody watching this program not to do [what we did]… get your own [personal] lawyer.” – Sandy Lerner →

“One day… seven vice-presidents of Cisco Systems showed up in my office… the outcome of which was a very simple alternative: either I relented and allowed the president to fire Sandy Lerner or they, all seven, would quit.” – Don Valentine →

“[Sandy and Len] urgently sold their shares in Cisco at a time when the valuation of the company was a mere $1B.” – Don Valentine →

"# The Equity Equation

As this nuclear winter of venture hacks continues, I thought you might enjoy our thoughts on Paul Graham’s The Equity Equation. Paul says,

“Whenever you’re trading stock in your company for anything, whether it’s money or an employee or a deal with another company, the test for whether to do it is the same. You should give up n% of your company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome enough that the (100 – n)% you have left is worth more than the whole company was before….

“In the general case, if n is the fraction of the company you’re giving up, the deal is a good one if it makes the company worth more than 1/(1 – n) [Ed: This is the equity equation].”

Read the rest of The Equity Equation first; it is great. As usual.

We have some additional thoughts. As usual. =)

Summary: 1. You have to pay market rates regardless of the equity equation. 2. Consider the opportunity cost of spending shares on employees and investors. 3. Offers from top-tier firms increase your valuation.

In practice, you raise money or hire an employee because you need to, not because you want to. And you have to pay a market rate no matter what the equity equation says.

Say the equity equation tells you to pay a prospective hire above market. You should still pay the hire a market rate and save the company some equity.

Say the equity equation tells you to pay a prospective hire below market. The hire will simply argue that the market values her higher, and that you should pay her a market rate. It’s tough to fight this normative leverage.

When you’re hiring, first figure out the market rate for the position. We previously posted a table of market rates for employees. When you evaluate a candidate, ask yourself whether she is likely to increase the next round’s share price (include the dilution of her market rate options). If the answer is yes, she is a possible hire. If no, she is a no hire. This approach forces you to think about building value, not filling a position.

“One of the things the equity equation shows us is that, financially at least, taking money from a top VC firm can be a really good deal. Greg Mcadoo from Sequoia recently said at a YC dinner that when Sequoia invests alone they like to take about 30% of a company. 1/.7 = 1.43, meaning that deal is worth taking if they can improve your outcome by more than 43%. For the average startup, that would be an extraordinary bargain. It would improve the average startup’s prospects by more than 43% just to be able to say they were funded by Sequoia, even if they never actually got the money.”

You need to consider the opportunity cost when you spend equity. You should only give out equity if it increases your share price optimally. You can buy a lot of things with your equity—buy things that increase your share price the most.

Is selling 30% of your shares to a top-tier firm the most effective way to spend your shares? What if another investor will give you the same terms for 20%? Should you take it? Could you spend the remaining 10% on killer developers and sales guys? Could you spend the savings on great advisors? Could you spend the  saved equity on the best board members money can buy?

Entrepreneurs should think about unbundling money and value add. Get money on the best terms and get the best value add.

Would you hire an investor to serve on your board if he didn’t bring money with him? If the answer is no, his value add is literally worthless. If the answer is yes, then put a price on that value add and adjust their offer (in their favor) so you can compare it to other offers apples-to-apples.

(Note: This is not an argument not to take money from top-tier firms, we have raised money from top-tier firms.)

“The reason Sequoia is such a good deal is that the percentage of the company they take is artificially low. They don’t even try to get market price for their investment; they limit their holdings to leave the founders enough stock to feel the company is still theirs.”

When a top-tier firm offers to invest, the market price for your company immediately goes up. Firms tend to invest in herds and everybody wants to steal a deal from a top-tier firm.

The last-and-final offer from a top-tier firm will be slightly less than market. They will argue that they should pay less because they bring a lot more value than their competitors, they have a brand, et cetera. But overall, an offer from a top-tier firm increases your valuation.

Top-tier firms try to avoid increasing your valuation when they make an offer. For example, they may give you an exploding term sheet. But, in practice, in this market, we rarely see exploding offers from any firm.

Many firms add lots of value and help like crazy. But entrepreneurs should understand that the top firms pick the best companies, they don’t make the best companies. They say so themselves.

The top firms are mainly in the business of making money for their limited partners by picking the startups that are going to succeed with or without their value add.

I would love to hear your thoughts…

"# The first 1000x in valuation is the easiest

I recently wrote that it’s “fair for founders to own about 100% of a startup while employee #1 only owns a few percent.”

My argument was that the dollar value of stock that founders get when they start the company is actually less than the dollar value of stock that employees get when they join the company. The disparity between founders and employees is therefore just a matter of timing.

There’s a corollary to this theorem:

The first 1000x in valuation is the easiest.

The first 1000x in stock appreciation is easier than the next 1000x. Here’s why:

Let’s say the company is worth $1 when you start. To get a 1000x increase in valuation, you only need to grow the company to $1000 in value. So if you join a company when it’s worth $1, you only have to create $999 of value for your stock to appreciate 1000x!

If someone else joins the company after it’s already worth $1000, he has to create $999,000 of value for his stock to appreciate 1000x!

To get a 1000x return on your stock, you either have to create $999 or $999,000 of value. One of these is easier. By 1000x.

The first 1000x is the easiest, because it is easier in an absolute sense.

"# The Human Equation How to organize people for profit

From The Human Equation:

“Seven dimensions that seem to characterize most if not all of the systems that produce profits through people.

The author is Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at Stanford. He also co-wrote Hidden Value, which we covered in We don’t pay you to work here.

Extreme Programming works well when you implement all of its practices. Most of the practices by themselves have too many flaws to be very effective. Each practice by itself may even have more disadvantages than advantages.

But all of the practices together work well. Why? For each practice, there are other practices that obviate its flaws. Wheels by themselves just roll a bit and fall over. But when you connect them to a car, the entire system can get you from Boston to San Francisco.

The practices in The Human Equation also work well when you implement them all. You can’t offer extensive training if you plan to lay people off when times are tough. That’s just a good way to waste money on training. You can’t offer employment security if you don’t hire new employees very selectively and if you don’t terminate the ones that aren’t effective.

If you’re searching for a magic incentive system to get high performance from your team, there isn’t one. If you’re willing to do the hard work of implementing a set of simple organizational practices, The Human Equation and Hidden Value have some suggestions.

"# The Option Pool Shuffle

“Follow the money card!”

– The Inside Man, Three-Card Shuffle

Summary: Don’t let your investors determine the size of the option pool for you. Use a hiring plan to justify a small option pool, increase your share price, and increase your effective valuation.

If you don’t keep your eyes on the option pool while you’re negotiating valuation, your investors will have you playing (and losing) a game that we like to call:

Option Pool Shuffle

 You have successfully negotiated a $2M investment on a $8M pre-money valuation by pitting the famous Blue Shirt Capital against Herd Mentality Management. Triumphant, you return to your company’s tastefully decorated loft or bombed-out garage to tell the team that their hard work has created $8M of value.

Your teammates ask what their shares are worth. You explain that the company currently has 6M shares outstanding so the investors must be valuing the company’s stock at $1.33/share:

$8M pre-money ÷ 6M existing shares = $1.33/share.

Later that evening you review the term sheet from Blue Shirt. It states that the share price is $1.00… this must be a mistake! Reading on, the term sheet states, “The $8 million pre-money valuation includes an option pool equal to 20% of the post-financing fully diluted capitalization.”

You call your lawyer: “What the fuck?!”

As your lawyer explains that the so-called pre-money valuation always includes a large unallocated option pool for new employees, your stomach sinks. You feel duped and are left wondering, “How am I going to explain this to the team?”

If you don’t keep your eyes on the option pool, your investors will slip it in the pre-money and cost you millions of dollars of effective valuation. Don’t lose this game.

Your investors offered you a $8M pre-money valuation. What they really meant was,

 “We think your company is worth $6M. But let’s create $2M worth of new options, add that to the value of your company, and call their sum your $8M ‘pre-money valuation’.”

For all of you MIT and IIT students out there:

$6M effective valuation + $2M new options + $2M cash = $10M post

or

60% effective valuation + 20% new options + 20% cash = 100% total.

Slipping the option pool in the pre-money lowers your effective valuation to $6M. The actual value of the company you have built is $6M, not $8M. Likewise, the new options lower your company’s share price from $1.33/share to $1.00/share:

 $8M pre ÷ (6M existing shares + 2M new options) = $1/share.

Update: Check out our $9 cap table which calculates the effect of the option pool shuffle on your effective valuation.

Proper respect must go out to the brainiac who invented the option pool shuffle. Putting the option pool in the pre-money benefits the investors in three different ways!

First, the option pool only dilutes the common stockholders. If it came out of the post-money, the option pool would dilute the common and preferred shareholders proportionally.

Second, the option pool eats into the pre-money more than it would seem. It seems smaller than it is because it is expressed as a percentage of the post-money even though it is allocated from the pre-money. In our example, the new option pool is 20% of the post-money but 25% of the pre-money:

$2M new options ÷ $8M pre-money= 25%.

Third, if you sell the company before the Series B, all un-issued and un-vested options  will be cancelled. This reverse dilution benefits all classes of stock proportionally even though the common stock holders paid for all of the initial dilution in the first place! In other words, when you exit, some of your pre-money valuation goes into the investor’s pocket.

More likely, you will raise a Series B before you sell the company. In that case, you and the Series A investors will have to play option pool shuffle against the Series B investors. However, all the unused options that you paid for in the Series A will go into the Series B option pool. This allows your existing investors to avoid playing the game and, once again, avoid dilution at your expense.

You can beat the game by creating the smallest option pool possible. First, ask your investors why they think the option pool should be 20% of the post-money. Reasonable responses include

Next, make a hiring plan for the next 12 months. Add up the options you need to give to the new hires. Almost certainly, the total will be much less than 20% of the post-money. Now present the plan to your investors:

“We only need a 10% option pool to cover us for the next 12 months. By your reasoning we only need to create a 10% option pool.”

Reducing the option pool from 20% to 10% increases the company’s effective valuation from $6M to $7M:

$7M effective valuation + $1M new options + $2M cash = $10M post

or

70% effective valuation + 10% new options + 20% cash = 100% total

A few hours of work creating a hiring plan increases your share price by 17% to $1.17:

 $7M effective valuation ÷ 6M existing shares = $1.17/share.

To allocate the option pool from the hiring plan, use these current ranges for option grants in Silicon Valley:

These are rough ranges – not bell curves – for new hires once a company has raised its Series A.  Option grants go down as the company gets closer to its Series B, starts making money, and otherwise reduces risk.

The top end of these ranges are for proven elite contributors. Most option grants are near the bottom of the ranges.  Many factors affect option allocations including the quality of the existing team, the size of the opportunity, and the experience of the new hire.

If your company already has a CEO in place, you should be able to reduce the option pool to about 10% of the post-money. If the company needs to hire a new CEO soon, you should be able to reduce the option pool to about 15% of the post-money.

Discuss your hiring plan with your prospective investors before you discuss valuation and the option pool. They may offer the truism that “you can’t hire good people as fast as you think.” You should respond, “Okay, let’s slow down the hiring plan… (and shrink the option pool).”

The only way to win at option pool shuffle is to not play at all. Put the option pool in the post-money instead of the pre-money. This benefits you and your investors because it aligns your interests with respect to the hiring plan and the size of the option pool.

Still, don’t try to put the option pool in the post-money. We’ve tried – it doesn’t work.

Your investor’s norm is that the option pool goes in the pre-money. When your opponent has different norms than you do, you either have to attack his norms or ask for an exception based on the facts of your case. Both straits are difficult to navigate.

Instead, skillful negotiators use their opponent’s standards and norms to advance their own arguments. Fancy negotiators call this normative leverage. You apply normative leverage in the option pool shuffle by using a hiring plan to justify a small option pool.

You can’t avoid playing option pool shuffle. But you can track the pre-money as it gets shuffled into the option pool and back into the investor’s pocket, you can prepare a hiring plan before the game starts, and you can keep your eye on the money card.

"# The spontaneous optimism that drives startups

In 1936 (!), old-school economic giant John Maynard Keynes described the spontaneous optimism that drives startups:

“A large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than mathematical expectations, whether moral or hedonistic or economic. Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as the result of animal spirits—of a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities.

“Enterprise only pretends to itself to be mainly actuated by the statements in its own prospectus, however candid and sincere. Only a little more than an expedition to the South Pole, is it based on an exact calculation of benefits to come. Thus if the animal spirits are dimmed and the spontaneous optimism falters, leaving us to depend on nothing but a mathematical expectation, enterprise will fade and die—though fears of loss may have a basis no more reasonable than hopes of profit had before.

“It is safe to say that enterprise which depends on hopes stretching into the future benefits the community as a whole. But individual initiative will only be adequate when reasonable calculation is supplemented and supported by animal spirits, so that the thought of ultimate loss which often overtakes pioneers, as experience undoubtedly tells us and them, is put aside as a healthy man puts aside the expectation of death.”

"# The Startup Game

Why Games Are Fun: The Psychology Explanation:

“Fun games operate on the principle that our actions will definitely bring us closer to the goal. If you go and slash rabbits (action), you will definitely gain experience points (relation), and you will eventually level up (goal).

“This is the reason so many people, including myself, have failed at difficult, uncharted things like entrepreneurship. There’s no guarantee that our next step will bring us closer to the goal. For example, we could easily invest 6 months into building a product that nobody wants to buy. Now, that specific problem can be ameliorated through processes of customer development, but the general problem still exists.

“If we get a job, we’re probably going to get paid for our labors.

“If we build a product and take it to market, we’re probably not going to get paid for our efforts. So where’s the motivation? It requires a lot of risk, and the human brain is not wired to consider long-term rewards! The nucleus accumbens, which may play a large role in the distribution of the phenomenon of pleasure and reward seeking, is part of the ancient limbic system, which motivates lots of behavior. Long-term goals require premeditated planning by the prefrontal cortex.”

"# The sultans of startup marketing

I recently re-connected with an up-and-coming venture capital Associate who thanked me for introducing her to the masterworks of Steve Blank and Eric Ries. I told her to check out Sean Ellis’ blog, and mentioned that I’ve learned just as much from Sean.

Later that night, she sent me a note: “Sean Ellis is awesome. Thanks so much.” Let me tell you why Sean is awesome.

First, Sean lead marketing from launch to IPO filing at LogMeIn and Uproar. He later worked with Xobni (Khosla Ventures, First Round Capital), Dropbox (Sequoia Capital), Eventbrite (Sequoia Capital), Grockit (Benchmark Capital), Flexilis (Khosla Ventures), eduFire (Battery Ventures)…  the list goes on. So all of his theory is backed by a wealth of experience across a broad range of startups.

Second, his startup pyramid changed my life and increased my bench press by 75 lbs. This is the best model I’ve seen on how to build a startup. Read it.



Finally, he shares a lot of his knowledge for free on his blog. Here are extracts from a few of his posts. Make sure you click through and read all of them in full. I read his blog from front-to-back when I first discovered it (start with the newer stuff).

When Should a Startup Start Charging?

“I’ve recently changed my long held belief that all startups should charge immediately upon the release of a new product.  I now believe that non-enterprise targeted startups should only charge once you have achieved product/market fit.  As explained in this earlier post, I define product/market fit as at least 40% of your active users saying they would be “very disappointed” if they could no longer use your product…

“For startups targeting enterprises, it actually does make sense to charge before reaching product/market fit.  This is the best way to help the enterprise figure out how to get value from your product (somebody on the inside will be motivated to work with you to unlock value since they’ve already spent the budget).  If you haven’t charged anything, your attempts to engage the customer and find value are likely to be perceived as an aggressive sales annoyance rather than genuinely helpful…

“Startups often delay implementing a business model claiming “we’re focused on growth right now.” But once you’ve achieved product/market fit, most startups will grow faster with a business model (I wrote a post on this earlier).  A business model gives you rational constraints within which you can execute very aggressively – otherwise you are held back by fear that you may be wasting money on paid marketing programs.”

The Startup Pyramid:

“Product/market fit has always been a fairly abstract concept making it difficult to know when you have actually achieved it…

“I’ve tried to make the concept less abstract by offering a specific metric for determining product/market fit. I ask existing users of a product how they would feel if they could no longer use the product. In my experience, achieving product/market fit requires at least 40% of users saying they would be “very disappointed” without your product. Admittedly this threshold is a bit arbitrary, but I defined it after comparing results across nearly 50 startups. Those that struggle for traction are always under 40%, while most that gain strong traction exceed 40%. Of course progressing beyond “early traction” requires that these users represent a large enough target market to build an interesting business…

“If you haven’t reached product/market fit yet it is critical to keep your burn low and focus all resources on improving the percentage of users that say they would be very disappointed without your product. Avoid bringing in VPs of Marketing and Sales to try to solve the problem. They will only add to your burn and likely won’t be any better than you at solving the problem. Instead, you (the founders) should engage existing and target users to learn how to make your product a “must have.” Sometimes it is as simple as highlighting a more compelling attribute of your product – but often it requires significant product revisions or possibly even hitting the restart button on your vision.”

To Pay Or Not To Pay To Acquire Users?

“I recently heard a VC say that startups “should spend the least amount of money possible on marketing.”  This is a healthier attitude than the opposite prescription of undisciplined land grab, but a better approach is pure ROI marketing.  Marketing opportunities that offer a fast payback with additional profit margin are a key component for reaching your startup’s full market potential…

“If your growth is accelerating, you will attract competition.  And this competition will likely be savvy enough to replicate the customer acquisition and monetization approaches that you worked hard to invent.  So it is important to make it as difficult as possible for them to get traction.  I know some of you are saying “but your recent post told us to ignore the competition.”  My point was not to ignore the competition forever, simply to ignore them while you are figuring out a repeatable, positive ROI way to acquire customers. Competition (especially those that are spending irrationally) will distract you from this critical task.

“But once you have optimized the first user experience and introduced a business model that generates sufficient revenue to fund user acquisition, it’s time to focus your marketing efforts to aggressively build new customer acquisition channels and scaling existing channels – both free and paid.”

I am a fan. And so can you.

"# Tips from a exVC who helps entrepreneurs raise money

 In 4 Things to Do After You Get Your First Term Sheet, Bill Burnham, a former partner at Mobius and Softbank Capital, writes,

“I’ve recently been involved in helping a couple companies with their first major round of VC financing.  It’s actually been pretty interesting for me because I have historically been on the other side of the table.  In addition to generating several stories worthy of “The Funded” and getting a better appreciation of the trials and tribulations that entrepreneurs must go through when trying to raise money, I also gained a better appreciation for just how important it is to properly manage the “end game” of a VC financing.

“What is the “end game”?  The End Game generally takes place after you have gotten a term sheet, but before you actually sign it.  How well you manage this process can make a big difference in the actual terms and pricing you ultimately get, so it pays to approach this process as thoughtfully and diligently as you do any other part of fundraising.”

“With that in mind I present 4 things that you should definitely do after getting your 1st term sheet:

“1. Get a second term sheet:  It may sound flip, but this is the single most important thing you should do upon getting your 1st term sheet.  Nothing loosens up a VC’s purse strings or makes them more flexible on a particular term than the threat of competition.  Without competition (real or perceived) you have very little leverage against a VC.   Now getting one term sheet, let alone two, is tough enough, but getting two must be your goal and you must not waiver in pursuit of that goal even you after you get the 1st one.  The biggest problem most entrepreneurs have executing on this strategy is that they have mismanaged the sequencing of their fundraising.  Many entrepreneurs make the mistake of pursuing an “in order” fundraising process whereby they take one meeting, run that process to its logical conclusion and if that doesn’t work out try to get a meeting with another VC.  VC fundraising must be pursued concurrently!  You must put as many irons in the fire in as short a time as possible so that all the firms start the process at roughly the same time. As firms progress through the process, you should do your best to try and “herd” them along by trying to slow down the ones pushing ahead and speed up the ones lagging behind.  The ultimate goal is to ensure that when you receive your first term sheet you have several other firms that are very close (within a week or so) to potentially issuing their own term sheets.  Proper sequencing ensures that you are not forced to take an inferior “bird in hand”.”

Read Bill’s great post for the rest of his suggestions. He agrees with everything we’ve been writing about, so he is obviously quite brilliant.

"# Top heavy startups

Seed-stage  investors don’t like top-heavy companies: CEO, COO, CXO, CYO, VP of X,  Y, and Z. It’s almost an immediate pass. No sophisticated investor is impressed by titles in an early stage startup.

If you’re an early-stage consumer internet company, you don’t need fancy titles, you need founders and employees who get can either build the product or sell it. (One of the founders should be the CEO so you can make decisions quickly.)

There are many exceptions to this bit of advice but, unless you really know what you’re doing (you’ve been starting companies and investing in them for the last 10 years), keep it simple. CEO, founders, engineers, salesmen, marketers. If one of the founders wants to be the President, give him an internal title, but keep it simple for investors.

"# Trust but verify Why investors want control

“Trust, but verify.”

– Ronald Reagan

Summary: Investors trust the entrepreneurs they back. But they verify their expectations with contracts and control. You should do the same—with the same tools investors use: contracts and control.

Why do investors want to control their investments through board seats and protective provisions? Shouldn’t they just give entrepreneurs bags of money and trust them to do the right thing?

David Hornik has the answer in Venture Capital in China:

“One investor with whom I met on my [China] trip described a recent situation in which he funded an entrepreneur, only to have that entrepreneur turn around and leave for business school months later. The entrepreneur assured the investor that he would be better situated to make the business a success after the two years of school. The investor had no recourse as his money left the country with the entrepreneur.

“In another instance, an investor backed an entrepreneur in a business that thereafter appeared to be failing. However, a couple years later when the same company started thriving, the entrepreneur informed the investor that it was not the company he had backed. The investor was incredulous. He told the entrepreneur that it was the very same company with the same team and even the same name. The entrepreneur assured the investor that it was, in fact, a different company and that he had not invested in this successful company, his investment was in the previous failed venture. Despite the obvious deception, the investor told me that he again had no legal recourse.

“…the legal structures needed to support a vibrant startup economy [in China] are, at best, embryonic. Neither entrepreneurs nor investors are particularly well protected by the Chinese legal system.”

Investors trust the entrepreneurs they back. They wouldn’t invest if they didn’t. Their trust is an expectation that entrepreneurs will:

Investors have been playing this game long enough to anticipate certain situations. So they use contracts and courts to enforce their expectations in those situations:

Investors trust entrepreneurs to stay at the company for 4 years, and they verify it with a vesting schedule.

Investors trust entrepreneurs to pay the investors first when the company exits, and they verify it with a liquidation preference.

Investors trust entrepreneurs to consider their interests in an acquisition, and they verify it with protective provisions and board seats.

Investors have been playing this game long enough to also know that you can’t anticipate every situation. So they use control to dispose the company towards the investor’s interests in unanticipated situations.

China doesn’t seem to have a legal system that lets investors and entrepreneurs verify their expectations. They have trust, but no verification.

But U.S. investors can trust and verify. And you should do the same—with the same tools investors use: contracts and control.

If you trust your investors to let you stick around long enough to vest all your shares, accelerate your vesting upon termination.

If you trust your investors to let the board make the call on acquisition offers, automatically suspend protective provisions when the offer is big enough (e.g. a 3x return).

If you trust your investors to let the founders run the company, control the board.

Writing a contract doesn’t mean you don’t trust the other guy. It just means you want to document and verify your trust.

"# Vinod Khosla I was much more of a glorified recruiter

Vinod Khosla at TechCrunch Disrupt:

“I think the single, most important fact about doing a startup is being clear about your vision and not letting it get distorted by what pundits and experts tell you.

“But the second most important thing is finding the right team. And that’s really, really hard, because people tend to look for people around them and so it’s the person who they happen to know as opposed to the best possible person to find.

“You know, I was relentless. It took a lot of time. I used to say when I was starting my first company, I was much more of a glorified recruiter than a CEO, or a founder. I really spent probably well over 50% of my time recruiting, and I encourage all entrepreneurs to try and do that.

“It’s also hard because you’ve never hired a marketing person. You don’t what a good marketing person is. You don’t even know what a good developer is. So whose judgment to trust, whose advice to take, is really really hard.”

Corollary: If you can’t recruit a good team, your vision probably needs distortion. Vinod’s quote starts at 19:20 in the video but I encourage you to watch the whole interview.

"# We dont pay you to work here

“A raise is only a raise for thirty days; after that, it’s just your salary.”

– David Russo, VP of Human Resources at SAS Institute

This is one of my favorite quotes from the book Hidden Value. It explains why money by itself doesn’t motivate high performance. Money by itself can only motivate the quest for more money. A raise is only a raise for thirty days; after that, it’s just your salary.

We are motivated to perform when our work expresses who we are, when the business’ goals are intrinsically meaningful to us, and we feel that we are valued as people, not simply as economic agents.

But, even in startups, financial incentives and HR practices often treat us like economic agents:

“Consider the implicit values conveyed in the modern management practices adopted by many companies. Most firms today emphasize, among other things, the employee’s responsibility for being career resilient, employment at will and no-fault dismissal, pay for performance, downsizing to cut costs, and maximizing shareholder value above all else. What is the message any sentient employee takes from these practices? Pursue what is best for you, not the firm or the customer, adopt a free-agent mentality, and do not invest any more in the firm than it is willing to invest in you. The underlying values are crystal clear, even if they are never expressed in a formal way. In this sense, arguments by managers that value statements are irrelevant or inappropriate miss the point: All organizations have values; the only question is how explicit they are about them.

“And what happens when employees behave in accordance with these values? First, a rational employee is not likely to exert much effort in activities beyond what he or she is explicitly rewarded for. A ‘show me the money’ mood prevails. Second, a smart employee will be constantly alert for new and better job opportunities in other organizations—loyalty is for fools. Third, unless cooperation is explicitly monitored and rewarded, teamwork is viewed as optional… To resolve some of these problems, management’s job is to design ever more sophisticated control and incentive systems to ensure that the necessary teamwork occurs and that the loss of intellectual capital is minimized.”

The problem isn’t that money is a weak motivator. The problem is that money is a terribly strong motivator. By itself, money motivates the wrong people to do the wrong things in the quest for more money.

This is why Zappos pays employees to leave. This is why Tandem Computers didn’t tell employees their salaries until after they started working. In other words: we don’t pay you to work here—we pay you so you can work here.

The authors, Charles A. O’Reilly III and Jeffrey Pfeffer, both from Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, studied how eight companies, from Men’s Wearhouse to Cisco, ignore the pernicious assumption that compensation should be the foundation for management systems:

“First, each of these companies has a clear, well-articulated set of values that are widely shared and act as the foundation for the management practices that… provide a basis for the company’s competitive success. [e.g. Southwest’s “Work should be fun… it can be play… enjoy it.”]

“Second, each of these organizations has a remarkable degree of alignment and consistency in the people-centered practices that express its core values. [e.g. Southwest: “We hire happy people.”]

“Finally, the senior managers in these firms, not just the founders or the CEO, are leaders whose primary role is to ensure that the values are maintained and constantly made real to all of the people who work in the organization… The senior managers in each of these companies see their roles not as managing the day-to-day business or even as making decisions about grand strategy but as setting and reinforcing the vision, values, and culture of the organization. Dennis Bakke at AES [a $2B company] claims that he made only two decisions in 1998, one of which was not to write a book on the company.”

The book’s subtitle is “How great companies achieve extraordinary results with ordinary people.”

Every rational company in the world is trying to hire the best people in the world. And all but one of them will fail at this task. There can only be one company with the best people. Hiring the best is a failing strategy.

Organizations must be designed to thrive with ordinary people. If businesses can thrive with the capabilities of ordinary people, they can also thrive with extraordinary people. Practices like Extreme Programming, that were designed for programmers with ordinary skills, work even better with extraordinary programmers.

Read Hidden Value for specific recruiting, training, information-sharing, and rewards practices that aim to exploit the capabilities of ordinary and extraordinary people alike.

“If people come for money, they will leave for money.”

"# We teach entrepreneurship like every vertical market has the same set of rules

Steve Blank: “What I began to realize is that we teach entrepreneurship like every vertical market and industry has the same set of rules. So the first heuristic I want to offer is that — even in this class — there really is no common ‘these rules work’ for all vertical markets and industries.”

Listen to this excerpt from the second class of Steve’s customer development course for the rest of this wonderful lesson.






Audio: Vertical markets (mp3)





Slides: Vertical markets (pdf)

Here’s a transcript of the lesson.

Steve Blank: How many are in Web 2.0? Like the social something web. How many are in enterprise software? Anybody in semiconductors? EDA? OK. Is there a biotech guy still here? Oh!

One of the interesting things about when I put up the fact that there are different industries or markets, everybody goes, “Well, yeah. Of course.” I’m going to tell you a very funny story.

When I started teaching in the engineering school of the school not-to-be-named down south, but it starts with an “S,” I formed teams just like you guys are going to do for projects. And I’d always say, “Listen, anybody can start a company. All you need is a half a million bucks.” OK, yes, sir, a half a million bucks. Write that down.

Next week there’s always a group that looks like these three people, that says, “Startup, half a million dollars.” It’s a divide by zero problems here, because in our business they’d come back and say, “Hey, Professor Blank, in our business the common wisdom is $100 million.”

And then I’d go, “Oh, well, yes of course, you’re in the life sciences, that’s completely different.” The next week I’d say, “Except for these guys who need $100 million, you ought to get out and start selling your product on day one, because you don’t need to worry about any IP at all. Web 2.0. Just go out and get out there.”

The next week someone raises their hand and says, “Professor Blank, in our industry there’s a ton of patents and stuff and people tell us we shouldn’t be out there unless we start patent protecting all our stuff.”

And I went, “Oh, oh, oh, you’re in a different vertical market. In that vertical market you’re absolutely right. But OK, let’s keep going on with the class. The rest of you guys can keep going out because you don’t need to worry about anything, about government regulation or anything. It’s a startup. Just go out there. There’s no regulation to worry about.”

The next week it’s a group that comes up and says, “Professor Blank, we’re doing a medical device and there’s something called the 510K, and that’s a two-year process.” And I go, “Oh, oh, for those of you in medical devices…”

And what I began to realize is that we teach entrepreneurship like every vertical market and industry has the same set of rules. So the first heuristic I want to offer is that even in this class, there really is no common “these rules work” for all vertical markets and industries.

And the first heuristic I want you to think about is, when you hear common advice from friends or other people who’ve done startups, always ask what industry were they in, and was that particular advice relevant for me or not.

So for example, here’s a checklist of — I just randomly picked these. Web 2.0, enterprise software, enterprise software, communications software, communications software, consumer electronics, games software, semiconductors, EDA, clean tech, medical devices, life sciences, and personalized medicine.

I think, I’ve probably screwed up a startup in almost every one of these. That was a joke.

Did I miss anybody’s vertical market? Anybody here who I didn’t kind of get? All right. So this is not meant as a comprehensive list, but usually it takes about 95% of those students in the room.

Steve Blank: Now what’s interesting is if I ask you, Eric, in your biotech startup, what’s your greatest risk? What is it?

Eric: Our team is working on an asthma inhaler.

Steve: Right. So what’s the biggest risk?

Eric: The efficacy.

Steve: Right. The efficacy of what?

Eric: The efficacy of the drug and its impacts. That’s a big risk.

Steve: So whether the product, as envisioned, works at all.

Eric: Right. And even if it works, are the adverse effects….

Steve: Does it kill you?

Eric: Yeah. Not to put too fine a point on it.

Steve: It’s a very nice clinician’s way of saying did it kill him or did he grow a third arm. How about you guys, do you have a particular drug or product in mind?

Student: The technology similar to some medical devices, the bio-monitoring… interactions.

Steve: So whether biomarkers are predicted, for a predictor from an assay you’re thinking about making.

Student: Yes.

Steve: So it’s a technical risk, right?

Student: Yes.

Steve: How many of you are thinking about a Web 2.0 startup? Great. What’s the risk, Josh? What’s the product?

Josh: It’s a digital media company.

Steve: Perfect. What’s the technical risk?

Josh: Finding the engineers.

Steve: Right. Is that a risk in Silicon Valley?

Josh: There’s not a lot of risk.

Steve: What’s the risk?

Josh: Getting people to use it.

Steve: Interesting. If our drug works for asthma, or your friends drug, does he have a customer problem?

Josh: No.

Steve: Why?

Josh: Because there are a lot of people that need….

Steve: If you’re running out of air, you’re going to probably want your drug, right? But you have a different problem. You could almost say, unless we really are stupid, we’re not going to screw up the technology. Wouldn’t you love it, if you were these guys, to be able to say that?

Josh: Yeah.

Steve: Big idea here. It’s a big idea, one that I’ve never heard articulated before at all with startups, yet world-class VCs know this on day one. There are some industries where the risk is purely customer in market.

And by purely I just mean, in Silicon Valley we take for granted digital media and web, with all due respect, for the hard work your software engineers are going to do getting it up, it’s not invention.

It’s, gee, did, they do it efficiently or did the Oracle salesman convince them to buy half a million bucks of software they didn’t need. But it’s not invention.

There’s a whole other set of industries where it truly is invention. Where it truly is, we should be so lucky to get this product working. Because if we get an asthma drug or an oncology for cancer curing drug, our only problem is how big is the licensing deal going to be? And not whether customers are going to want this.

Is this distinction clear? When you start a company, question one to self. Memo to self. Am I in a market risk company? Or am I in an invention risk company?

Steve Blank: And by the way, I said this in the first class, I’ll remind you again, though. I’m happy to have every one of you in the class, but if you are in an invention risk company, now I’ll talk about hybrid companies in a second. Invention risk company, this class can offer you nothing.

To the extent that, what customer development is about, is how to dramatically reduce market risk. It is not how to reduce invention risk. So if I lose three of you next week. But you’re more than welcome, I just want to understand…

Student: I’m a hybrid.

Steve: I’m sorry?

Student: I’m a hybrid.

Steve: You’re a hybrid. And I’ll talk about hybrids in a second. Is that clear so far? Memo to self, duh! Can we assume the technology works and our problem is whether the product and market fit is correct? Or is in fact, the product itself the risk factor. But I have something says both.

Give me an example of a vertical market or an industry that has both risks.

Student: Semiconductor?

Steve: Perfect. Why?

Student: Because the technology is fairly advanced. There’s a lot of new insight there. But then the customers are very finicky, maybe, in the type of devices…

Steve: Let’s get specific. What kind of semiconductors do you have in mind? That has technology risk.

Student: Say, consumer electronics or…

Steve: Give me more specific than that. Anyone else in the semiconductor business? You raised your hands in the beginning, now you’re hiding. Yes?

Student: Yes, the industry I work in, we target what the customers want.

Steve: Right, so give me a specific case of technology risk in semiconductors.

Student: Like a high speed serial interface.

Steve: Perfect. OK. Or better, a new graphics architecture, or a new CPU architecture, or you’re making a new IBM cell architecture. Yeah, that’s on the bleeding edge. We don’t even know if the architecture is going to work. Right? I just want to be clear.

Semiconductors, if you’re just making a faster version of some one else’s chip, you’re not taking too much technical risk, are you? I mean, whether you can push it faster.

But typically in semiconductors, if you’re taking architectural risk, if you really have some insight you believe, or communications hardware.

Pushing the envelope is usually about how deep you can go into packet inspection, to how fast and et cetera. Those are some pretty serious trade-offs. You don’t know if this stuff works until you get first use out of the way. Is that fair?

Student: Yep.

Steve: That’s the technical risk. What’s the market risk in that kind of semiconductor business? What’s the customer risk there? Anybody? You don’t even have to be in the semiconductor business. Yes.

Student: For example, they could really mean technology. They could build a chip.

Steve: Yes.

Student: But for some reason, in benchmarking for the system provider assistance is another. Another vendor. Or even more, the old standard just doesn’t pick up.

Steve: Right. So you could have a neat, new architecture, but your competitor could kick your butt. By convincing all the platform people who have to design your product in, “Oh, listen. That’s so incompatible. It uses 62 Hz, rather than 60 Hz of electricity. You’ll never be able to use it.” By the way, I once convinced an entire industry of that, but that’s another story.

So you could win on technical risk, and lose in market risk in hybrid technology. Give me another example. I picked Semiconductors. What’s another one?

Student: I used to do R&D groups with Blu-ray.

Steve: Perfect, talk to me.

Student: I don’t know much about it, but basically from a technical stand point, it seems like you’re pretty similar technology. But it obviously, Sony and company convinced the company prior to movie studios that they’re better off just shipping their content with Blu-ray rather than the DVD medium.

Steve: So this was the next standard for DVD’s. Right? For the last three or four years. Huge battles over who would be the supplier. Lots of chess games, lots of technical risk.

Because even at the end, they were still playing games with the spec and adding more security layer and what ever. At the end of the day, Blu-ray won. Didn’t win on technology, it won because they finally got a critical mass of people to design in the product.

Now the irony is, who do you think might actually, ultimately win? Who may undercut?

Student: Streaming Hi-Def?

Steve: Streaming Hi-Def. Right? It might be that the current DVD standard might have been the last one that sold upon these that it is. Most people, certainly my kids, don’t go out and ever buy DVD’s.

They download stuff to their iPods or Macs or some thing else, or to streaming video. Oops. They’re all an investment. You might have just built the product that no one else wants.

So I just want to point out that when you look at a startup, ask those fundamental questions on day one. What problem do we think we have besides who are we, what business are we in, and what ever. It’s like, are we going to be risking trying to understand our customers and we ought to try to focus on that.

Or is the focus truly inside the building. Because Steve, it doesn’t matter what customers think unless we really nail this technology. None of this matters.

"# What are supra pro rata rights

I read, like, and regularly disagree with a great blog called Ask the VC . They recently answered a question about supra pro rata rights—here are our thoughts on the topic.

Q: Can you explain what supra pro-rata is? It seems to be showing up in some VC term sheets now. What’s the impact on the entrepreneur? How hard should one try to negotiate it out? If a VC insists on this term, should the entrepreneur walk away?

A: First, read Ask the VC’s response—we agree with them. Here are our additional thoughts.

An investor with supra pro rata rights wants the option of increasing his percent ownership in the next round. He probably told you “We like this company so much we might want to buy more of it!”

Investors who want to increase their percent ownership try to drive down the next round’s valuation. Whether or not they have supra pro rata rights.

They are at odds with the founders and management who are trying to increase the next round’s valuation. These investors can exercise their protective provisions to veto everything but the lowest valuation offer. Or they can signal the “correct” valuation to new investors:

If the current investors want to increase their percent ownership, the valuation is too low. If they don’t want to increase their percent ownership, the valuation is too high. This makes it harder to get a high valuation since the new investors often believe the current investors have a better sense for the right valuation.

You prefer investors who make it a policy of maintaining their percent ownership in the next round. This incents them to increase the next round’s valuation.

These investors don’t try to increase their percent ownership because they know it puts them at odds with the founders and management. They know it incents them to use their protective provisions to veto good offers. They know it forces them to signal their sense of the correct valuation.

Your response to supra pro-rata rights is:

“Everybody around the table should be working together to get a high valuation in the next round. Investors and management shouldn’t be at odds with each other in the next financing—let’s create alignment, not mis-alignment.”

Investors who try to decrease their percent ownership in the next round are also bad news. They signal that the valuation is too high. (Angels and seed stage funds are an exception. They’re not necessarily expected to maintain their percent ownership since they may not have a lot of capital.)

Use the comments to share your experiences and questions about supra pro rata rights—we’ll discuss the most interesting ones in a future article.

"# What are the benefits of debt in a seed round

Summary: Convertible debt is often the best choice for a seed round. It is convenient, cheap, and quick. It lets you close the financing quickly and turn your focus back to your customers—that’s good for the company and its investors.

When your business is very young, raising a seed financing ($50K-$500K) via convertible debt is a great alternative to selling equity. Convertible debt is also known as a bridge loan since it ‘bridges’ the company to its next financing.

Convertible debt (debt for short) is not like getting a loan from a bank. A bank expects to get its loan back. With convertible debt, the lender and your company both expect to convert the debt into equity when you close the Series A. Read  Yokum Taku’s series on convertible debt for a primer on this lovely financial instrument.

Seed stage debt rounds are much simpler than equity rounds, especially if your investors are angels. There isn’t a lot to hack in these agreements. You need to be more careful if you raise debt from venture capitalists, but a debt financing with a VC is still much simpler than an equity financing with a VC.

Why is debt a great alternative to equity in a seed round? Convenience, suitability, control, cost, and speed.

Debt agreements are easy to understand and hard to screw up, two great benefits if you’re raising the first financing of your life.

A debt term sheet is no longer than one or two pages and the closing documents are no longer than ten pages. There aren’t many terms to negotiate in a debt agreement.

Compare this to a Series A  term sheet which is as long as all of the closing documents for a debt round. Negotiating and closing debt is good practice for the  negotiation of the 25 terms in a typical Series A term sheet.

Who knows how to determine a suitable valuation and investor rights for a seed stage company?

The company’s valuation and leverage is changing quickly as it goes from nothingness to product, users, and revenue.

The founders are unlikely to negotiate a valuation that meets their high minimum expectation since there isn’t much competition to invest in the young and risky business.

But a valuation that does meet the founder’s minimum expectations may be too high and result in a down round in the Series A. The down round leaves the founders feeling like they lost money even though the company made  progress, the angels feeling like they took risk but got squashed, and the Series A investors feeling like they are dealing with unsophisticated operators.

Finally, it’s tough to reach a high Series A valuation soon after setting a low or moderate valuation in a seed round. Your Series A investors won’t want to pay a much higher share price than seed investors who bought stock just a few months ago.

Raising debt avoids setting a valuation, delays negotiating detailed investor rights,  avoids the option pool shuffle, and gives the seed stage investors an upside through a discount and/or warrants.

Founders usually continue to control a company after a debt round.

They control a majority, or all, of the board seats. Debt investors, especially angels, don’t necessarily want board seats. Seed stage equity investors, especially venture capitalists, often do. Controlling the board reduces the burden of reporting to the board and diminishes the likelihood of disagreements between the board and management.

The founders also control a majority of the company’s common stock. There is no preferred stock. They can sell the company for $10M, give $2M to the debt investors, and take home $8M. Try doing that with equity investors who have preferred stock with protective provisions that allow them to veto a sale of the company. In particular, venture capitalists often have big funds and they’re looking for big returns, not $10M exits.

Finally, if you raise debt, you can create and run a profitable business that doesn’t need an ‘exit’. Angels may be happy getting a big dividend from your company every quarter, whether they bought debt or equity. Venture capitalists aren’t looking for a quarterly dividend—they need to sell or IPO a company to return a profit to their investors (their limited partners). Raising debt from VCs maintains the option of building a ‘non-exiting’ business—you can always pay their debt back when it comes due. That said, we don’t recommend taking debt from VCs with the plan of building a ‘non-exiting’ business—that’s disingenuous.

You can negotiate a debt term sheet and close the money for under $10K in legal fees. There are very few terms for the lawyers to discuss—they will barely have to modify their boilerplate documents.

Negotiating a Series A term sheet and closing it can cost $20K-$60K in legal fees. Why would you or your investors want to spend that much money on legal fees when you’re raising a $100K seed round?

You can further reduce your legal fees by reading our convertible debt hacks and Yokum’s convertible debt articles while you work with your lawyers. (Venture Hacks is not  legal advice!)

Once your investors are ready to talk terms, you can negotiate a term sheet in one week and close the deal one week after that. The documents are short and simple—there isn’t much to discuss. Compare this to an equity financing which can take two weeks to negotiate and 4-6 weeks to close.

Convertible debt is often the best instrument for a seed round. You can close the debt cheaply and quickly and then turn your focus back to your customers. That’s good for the company and its investors since speed is a major competitive advantage of a startup. If you or your investors are veering away from convenience, low cost, and speed, you are missing the point of seed stage debt!

The seed stage is the worst possible time for the founders to negotiate an equity financing. The company is nebulous, the founders are inexperienced, and the company is starved for cash and time. The team should be testing hypotheses about their business, not negotiating complicated term sheets.

Investors who market themselves as ‘business partners’ should agree that they can add a lot of value to the business by doing the financing quickly and letting the team get back to their customers.

Use the comments to share your thoughts and questions on the benefits of debt vs. equity. We’ll discuss the most interesting comments in a future article.

Our next convertible debt hack shows you how to compare the economics of debt vs. equity.

"# What do investors look for in a startup

A few days ago, I posted a video where fellow Venture Hacker Naval Ravikant answers the age-old question:

What do you look for in a startup?

I liked his answer and transcribed/paraphrased it below:




(Video: Interview with Naval Ravikant.)

“There’s no silver bullet or magic answer but I actually do have a set of criteria I’ve come up with based on my own startups, after looking back on what worked.

“I look for two things that are paramount above all:

“There are three more factors that I look at. Not all three of them are required but I prefer a company to have at least two of them:

“There’s a small number of companies that are very good and very qualified and they get an embarrassingly large number of offers. And there’s a large number of companies that miss on one or two of these dimensions and they pound the fund-raising pavement and don’t get anything.

“This makes sense when you think about it because this is a hit-driven business: a small number of companies account for all the returns. So when people recognize what they think is a winning company, they will pay almost anything and they will do almost anything to invest in that company. And when they look at what they think is a non-winning company, they just say “bye”.

“It’s very similar to Hollywood where there are a few blockbusters and a lot of indie films made. Everyone’s got a camera but odds are you have an indie film. So go back to these five criteria and think about your blockbuster.”

My criteria are a little different. Yes, you need a great team in a big market (preferably, the team has years of experience with their customer).

The only other thing I look for is an amazing product. What makes a product amazing? You know it when you see it. The founders must be chasing a big vision with a beautiful product that is going to make a dent in the universe.

A great product automatically satisifies the technology, distribution, and monetization criteria. Great products are always hard to build. Grafting distribution onto something that isn’t great is a band-aid and a waste of time. It might work, but who wants to spend their lives doing it? Finally, a great product in a big market will either make a lot of money or shrink the market.

Knowing these criteria is one thing. Applying them effectively is another; I hope to learn how someday. It takes practice, diversification, and an aesthetic sensibility.

"# What should I send investors Part 2 Deck

“PowerPoint plans greatly increase your chance of getting a term sheet, or at least the dignity of a quick no.”

— David Cowan, Bessemer Venture Partners

Summary: An introduction and elevator pitch are critical to getting a meeting. You can also provide a “ten-slide” deck that tells a compelling story about your team, product, traction, and plans.

Bonjour!: If you like this article, check out our free e-book on Pitching.

A PowerPoint plan (“deck”) is less important than an elevator pitch, and an elevator pitch is less important than an introduction. Read What should I send investors? Part 1: Elevator Pitch for tips on crafting an elevator pitch. Many investors will just skim a deck and take a meeting if the introduction and elevator pitch are good.

But you can still send a deck. A deck lets investors learn more about your company. It demonstrates that you’ve thought about the company in detail. It’s an industry norm. And you need one for presentations anyway.



The best deck template in the universe is David Cowan‘s How To Not Write A Business Plan—use it. There are other templates from excellent sources on the Web, but this is the best.

Read David Cowan’s article and apply these headings and minor changes:

This sequence of slides tells a story:

We have a mission and a team that is taking us there. Why? We discovered a large problem and solved it with a product that has this amazing technology inside. We’re going to market and sell it to these customers, with these advantages over our competitors. In particular, we’re working towards these milestones over the next few quarters. In conclusion, this financing is a great investment opportunity.

The product isn’t revealed until the fifth slide of this methodical sequence—that’s annoying. Fortunately, the elevator pitch and Summary slide kill the suspense by summarizing your company and product before an investor jumps into the deck.

Keep the slides simple, visual, and minimal, with 30 point or larger font. The slides will look great when you present; see Gates,  Jobs, & the Zen aesthetic. (We’ll cover presentations in a future article, this article is about the deck you send investors.)

Put talking points, reasoning, and prose in the notes that accompany each slide. Don’t try to cram cogent arguments into bullet points on the slides; see The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint.

Email a PDF that combines each slide and its notes on a single page; slide on top, notes on bottom. Please don’t email a PowerPoint file unless your deck contains critical animations or movies.

You now have a single file for emails and live presentations. An investor can read the slides and notes together and imagine a presentation. And you can present the slides while you refer to the notes.

Finally, try Keynote if you’re on a Mac. It makes beautiful decks and it’s fun to use.

"# What should I send investors Part 3 Business Plans NDAs and Traction

Summary: Don’t send long business plans to investors. Don’t ask for NDAs. Don’t share information that must remain confidential. Understand that investors care about traction over everything else.

Hola! If you like this article, check out our free e-book on Pitching.

In Parts 1 and 2 of ‘What should I send investors?’, we covered the elevator pitch and deck. In this article, we present a few dos and don’ts of sending collateral to investors.

“Nothing slows down a VC as much as a comprehensive business plan.”

— David Cowan, Bessemer Venture Partners

Don’t send a 50-page business plan to investors. Nobody reads them and nobody executes them. Investors who want a long plan look bad—so do companies that generate them.

The milestones slide of your deck summarizes the company’s plan for the next 1-3 quarters. Document your detailed plans on a napkin, wiki, spreadsheet, deck, to-do list, or whatever. Share it with investors sometime around your second meeting and make sure they generally agree with your plan.

But don’t send investors a 50-page sales pitch that you call a business plan—an elevator pitch and deck are sufficient. You don’t need an executive summary either—an elevator pitch and deck are sufficient.

“Because of the large number of business plans… that we review, and the similarity of many such plans… we cannot accept responsibility for protecting against misuse or disclosure of any confidential or proprietary information…”

— Sequoia Capital

Getting an NDA from professional investors is almost impossible. It can happen (like a rainbow!), but you shouldn’t bother.

Investors don’t sign NDAs because they don’t want to get sued over them. Competing companies tend to get started at the same time because the market timing is right. Investors don’t want you to sue them if they fund your competitor—so they don’t sign NDAs. Read Why Most VC’s Don’t Sign NDAs by Brad Feld to learn more.

Asking for an NDA creates a barrier to getting funded—aren’t there enough barriers already? And this barrier is insurmountable: your request will be declined or, worse, ignored because you haven’t done your homework.

Accept the fact that your elevator pitch and deck will contain information that you don’t want printed on the front page of the Wall Street Journal. Fortunately, they won’t get that far.

Write “Proprietary and Confidential. Please do not distribute. Prepared for Blue Shirt Capital,” on the cover of your deck (some folks write it on every page). They’re less likely to forward it if their name is on it. And ask any recipients, in writing, via email, to kindly not distribute the deck outside their firm.

And if you must keep something absolutely confidential, don’t email it to investors and don’t mention it in person. Investors often look at several similar companies at once. Your plans probably won’t get to your competitors, but you should assume they will.

“Do whatever is required to get to product/market fit. Including changing out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don’t want to, telling customers yes when you don’t want to, raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital—whatever is required.”

— Marc Andreessen

Whether they’re reading an elevator pitch or listening to a presentation, investors care most about actual traction in a seemingly large market.

If you have incredible traction in what seems to be a large market, you can raise money no matter what the product and team look like—although a good product and team will improve your terms.

If you don’t have incredible traction but the market seems large, your product and team are both critical to raising money.

If the market doesn’t seem large to them, investors won’t care about your product or your team.

Traction is demonstrated profit, revenue, customers, pilot customers, or users (in order of importance), and their rates of change, and the rates of change of the rates of change, and the rates of change of…

"# Whats the biggest mistake entrepreneurs make





Q: What’s the biggest mistake entrepreneurs make when they’re raising money?

Entrepreneurs focus on valuation when they should be focusing on controlling the company through board control and limited protective provisions.

Valuation is temporary, control is forever. For example, the valuation of your company is irrelevant if the board terminates you and you lose your unvested stock.

The easiest way to maintain control of a startup is to create good alternatives while you’re raising money. If you’re not willing to walk away from a deal, you won’t get a good deal. Great alternatives make it easy to walk away.

Create alternatives by focusing on fund-raising: pitch and negotiate with all of your prospective investors at once. This may seem obvious but entrepreneurs often meet investors one-after-another, instead of all-at-once.

Focusing on fund-raising creates the scarcity and social proof that close deals. Focus also yields a quick yes or no from investors so entrepreneurs can avoid perpetually raising capital.

Q: What’s the biggest mistake VCs make?

The biggest opportunity for venture firms is differentiation. VCs compete for deals, and differentiation is the only way to compete.

Most firms offer the same product: a bundle of money plus the promise of value-add. And the few firms that are differentiated don’t communicate their differentiation to entrepreneurs. Y Combinator is an example of differentiated capital with excellent marketing communications.

Venture firms that thrive by investing in game-changing businesses have barely begun to differentiate themselves, let alone changed the rules of their own game.

Note: These excellent questions are adapted from Ashkan Karbasfrooshans’s Venture Hacks interview.

"# Whats the difference between smart money and dumb money

Q: Everybody is telling us to raise smart money. What’s the difference between smart money and dumb money?

“The best assumption to make is that your VC’s primary value add is the cash they are investing. Then you’ll always be surprised on the upside.”

— Marc Andreessen

Summary: Smart money is money plus the promise of help that’s worth paying for, dumb money is money plus hidden harm, and mostly money is mostly money. Weed out the dumb money with diligence. Evaluate supposedly smart money with the smart money test. Finally, assume your investors are mostly money: unbundle money and value-add to get money on the best terms possible and value-add on the best terms possible.



If smart money is money plus the promise of help that’s worth paying for, then dumb money is money plus hidden harm, and mostly money is mostly money. All three provide what entrepreneurs primarily want from investors: money.

Don’t assume any investor won’t be harmful. Do the diligence to prove otherwise:

After you’ve weeded out the dumb money, do the smart money test on everybody else:

Would you add the investor to your board of directors (or advisors) if he didn’t come with money?

If the answer is no, he is mostly money (see below). If the answer is yes, subtract some dilution from his investment since he’s eliminating the cost of a value-add director or advisor. You’re paying for the smart money investor—with his own money!

A smart money investor can be very valuable because he is good enough to be an advisor or board member and he owns enough to really care about the company in good times and bad times. An advisor or independent director won’t own enough of the company to really care if the company is in trouble—his career isn’t on the line like an investor’s.

But! If the investor you thought was smart doesn’t add value, you can’t fire him like an advisor or director and get your money back. You can only hope to ignore him. Which is why it is safer to…

Whether you raise smart money or mostly money, you should raise money as if your investors were mostly money. In other words, unbundle money and value-add. Get money on the best terms possible and get value-add on the best terms possible.

You can buy advice and introductions for 1/10th of the price that most investors charge. An investor will buy 15–30% of your company. An advisor or independent director will require 0.25–2.5% of your company with a vesting schedule of 2–4 years.

An advisor or independent director will be hand-picked from the population of planet Earth. He should be more effective than someone picked from the vast pool of investors who want to invest in your company.

He will own common stock, unlike an investor who owns preferred stock with additional rights.

And he won’t have conflicting responsibilities to his venture firm, other venture firms, or limited partners.

Value-add is great but it comes after money-add. First, find a money-add investor who will make an investment decision quickly, who is humble and trustworthy, who will treat you like a peer, who shares your vision, and is betting on you, not the market.

"# When investors try to renegotiate a term sheet



In Be Careful Who You Deal With, Matt McCall, a Managing Director at DFJ Portage, has great advice for entrepreneurs who are dealing with “slimy bottom sucker” investors:

“As these markets continue their chaotic path downward, people’s true colors come out. Some people show increasing amounts of fairness and consideration. Others will self-optimize and use every bit of leverage that they can get their hands on.

“Two entrepreneur friends of mine recently had a very negative experience with an investor who has a reputation for being Machiavellian and it really, really has incensed me.  These slimy bottom suckers use the changing market conditions to test how low they can retrade an existing deal.  Here is the standard game plan for these kinds of assholes. When they sense a dramatic change in the market, they pull away their term sheet siting “policy” changes. However, instead of walking away from the deal, they mention in passing that they might reconsider under “different terms”. If the entrepreneur bites, they know that they have leverage and they proceed to throw down absolutely egregious terms (multiple liquidation preference, half the original price, etc). If the entrepreneur bites on this, they know they really have them and continue to ratchet down the terms until things break and they back off.”

Read the rest of Matt’s post to learn how you can counter this investor’s game with your own game theory.

Machiavellian investors will try this trick in good markets too (I’ve seen it happen). Once you sign a term sheet, the investor will try to retrade terms. By then, you’ve told other prospective investors that you’ve signed a term sheet. It’s hard to go back to them and explain what’s happening. And if you walk away from the signed term sheet, it’s hard to talk to new investors with a blown-up term sheet on your hands.

Of course, Machiavellian entrepreneurs exist too. And VCs have enough “institutional knowledge” to know that. Unfortunately, most entrepreneurs don’t have commensurate knowledge about their counterparts.

"# When the cost of customer acquisition exceeds your ability to monetize them

David Skok, serial entrepreneur turned VC at Matrix Partners:

“In the many thousands of articles advising entrepreneurs on what they have to focus on to build successful startups, much has been written about three key factors: team, product and market, with particular focus on the importance of product/market fit. Failure to get product/market fit right is very likely the number 1 cause of startup failure. However in all these articles, I have not seen any discussion about what I believe is the second biggest cause of startup failure: the cost of acquiring customers turns out to be higher than expected, and exceeds the ability to monetize those customers… [emphasis added]


“A quick look around all the B2C startups shows that, although viral growth is often hoped for, in reality it is extremely rare. When it does happen, the associated businesses are usually extremely attractive, provided they have a way to monetize their customers. (For more on the topic of Viral Growth, refer to my blog post on that topic here.)

“Far more common is a need to acquire customers through a series of steps like SEO, SEM, PR, Social Marketing, direct sales, channel sales, etc. that will cost the company significant amounts of money. What shocks and surprises many first time entrepreneurs is just how high the numbers are for CAC [Cost to Acquire Customers] using these kinds of techniques.”

Read the rest of David’s excellent post: Startup Killer: the Cost of Customer Acquisition. But don’t worry about it too much until you’ve built a product people want. It’s hard to know what the CAC is before you know what the product is. And check out the rest of David’s new blog — his post on Viral Cycle Time is great.

"# When to fire your cofounders

The best strategy for not having to fire your co-founders is to not bring them on board in the first place.

One of the most common early-stage startup mistakes is building a weak founding teams. Since a good team is often the closest you can get to a good business plan, this one anti-pattern is the cause of many company failures. Before we dig into why this happens so frequently and what entrepreneurs can do about it, I want to share one of the formative stories from my early days as a VC.

Many years ago, I met a 20-something technical founder who had recently left graduate school with interesting technology in the enterprise search and knowledge management market. Beyond his compelling personality and the technology, he had an impressive approach that allowed him to deliver benefits to users without prior user setup or explicit user actions, using desktop and email client integration. To use a current analogy, it was like Xobni but better.

A week later, he came to Polaris with his founding team. He had three co-founders. They all had grey hair and so-so backgrounds. Over the course of an hour, I learned one of the three was a relative who, after hearing about the idea, pushed himself onto the team as “the business guy” and then promptly brought in a couple of former co-workers as co-founders. The net effect was that a backable founder had become essentially unfundable. I passed on the deal. As expected, the company went nowhere. I am friends with the founder and would like to back him some day.

This is an extreme example, but it underscores the randomness by which founding teams are created. Three disclaimers before we dive into the issues:

Arrogance and ignorance, in small doses, are powerful tools that help entrepreneurs focus and execute against overwhelming odds. In larger doses they make a dangerous poison that kills startups. In most cases, they are the root cause behind weak founding teams.

It’s no secret that startup business plans tend to evolve over time, sometimes substantially. Yet, at any given point along that evolutionary path, many entrepreneurs are over-confident that, this time, the plan will succeed. Then they look at the founding team and, if they think they are missing a key role, they may bring a co-founder on board. This process repeats itself up to the point where either the company converges to what it will likely end up doing in the next few months or the founding team gets to a size that makes additions practically impossible.

I recently met an entrepreneur who started working on a consumer social media idea about a year ago. Thinking he was building a small dot-com, he brought on a college buddy who had done Amazon Web Services work as a chief technical officer (CTO). In a few months, the idea shifted toward working with agencies. He brought in a VP of marketing from the agency space, because he was confident that was where the opportunity was. After a few more months, the team realized there was only a services business in the agency space. Now they are pivoting towards expert identification/collaboration in enterprises, and neither his CTO nor his VPM is right for the team.

The entrepreneur in this example is a smart guy. But he didn’t have enough experience to understand what would be required for a co-founder role over the early evolutionary path of the company. He didn’t fully appreciate the opportunity cost of making these early hires given his limited recruiting network and the pre-product, pre-funding stage of the company. Further, he did not know how to evaluate a VP of marketing. He ended up with a communications-oriented exec who — beyond lacking understanding of the enterprise domain — is not very helpful in general with product marketing issues. This is how ignorance hurts.

Keep in mind that when you recruit or you pitch investors, they don’t get the benefit of the history that might explain your decisions. Let’s imagine what goes on in a VC’s head:

“Shoot, this is a backable entrepreneur and the idea may have legs but the two other founders are B players and a poor fit for the company at this point. I could talk to the lead founder, but I don’t know about the personal relationships on the team and this can backfire. Also, I don’t want word getting out that I break founding teams. This can hurt my dealflow. Anyway, the CEO showed poor judgment in bringing these people on board. Also, there is still a lot of recruiting work to do whether the team changes happen before or after an investment. Frustrating… this could have been a good seed deal. Now it’s too complicated. I’ll pass using some polite non-reason.”

There is a principle in agile development that centers on minimizing wasted effort. One of the cornerstone strategies — supposedly one of Toyota’s rules, too — is to delay decisions until the last responsible moment. Because the future is uncertain, the idea is to make decisions with the most information. The emphasis is on “responsible,” because a lot of procrastination is bad too.

Last week, I wrote about how to raise money without lying to investors with this same principle. The logic also applies to building strong founding teams. Because you don’t know what your startup will end up doing, it can be a big mistake to hire the best people for this point in the company’s life.

The obvious solution is to build an amazing team of well-rounded, experienced athletes who can do anything that comes their way. The Good-to-Great companies put the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus. If you can do it, more power to you. However, you may have a few problems…

I am an entrepreneur, and I have team-building problems:

Here are some specific strategies for building founding teams. There are no silver bullets. Some of the advice is contradictory and situation-specific. Caveat entrepreneur.

If you successfully apply these strategies, you stand a better chance of going after the right people at the right time and bringing top talent on board.

You may not even have to fire your co-founders.

"# Who makes the best introductions to investors

“VCs are generally bombarded by requests for meetings, so a warm introduction helps an entrepreneur’s request float to the top of the list.”

Chris Wand, Managing Director, Foundry Group

Summary: The best way to get a meeting with an investor is through an introduction from someone he listens to. The best intros probably come from entrepreneurs that the investor has worked with. But the specifics of the middleman’s relationship with the investor are more important than the middleman’s day job. Finally, skip intros from (1) investors who don’t have a good reason why they’re not investing and (2) middlemen who barely know the investor.

The best way to get a meeting with an investor is through an introduction from someone he listens to. (You could cold call him but you better have a great elevator pitch and you should read How Should I Approach a VC I Don’t Know?.)

But not all introductions are created equal. Who makes the best introductions? Introducing the Hierarchy of Middlemen:



The specifics of your middleman’s relationship with the investor are more important than this list. So figure out why the investor is going to pay attention to the introduction by asking questions like:

How do you know the investor? What did you work on together? What companies have you sent him that he has subsequently backed? What makes our company interesting enough for you to make an introduction?

You don’t want introductions from investors who don’t want to do the deal and don’t have a good reason why. An introduction by a middleman who can and should invest but doesn’t want to invest is a strong negative signal. Skip this introduction.

And you don’t want intros from people the investor doesn’t really know or doesn’t listen to—that just makes you look bad. If the introduction starts with “I don’t know if you remember me,” you’re in trouble.

"# Why do investors want protective provisions

“AOL almost sold to Compuserve in 1991 for $60M. The VCs wanted to sell. [Steve] Case won by 1 vote. 10 years later, [AOL was] worth $100 billion.”

– Mark Pincus

Summary: Protective provisions let preferred shareholders veto certain actions, such as selling the company or raising capital. They protect the preferred, who are minority shareholders, from unfair actions by the common majority. However, the preferred shouldn’t use protective provisions to serve their other interests.

Protective provisions let preferred shareholders veto certain actions, such as selling the company or raising capital. Roughly, they state that

“The Company requires the consent of the holders of at least X% of the Company’s Series A Preferred to (i) effect a sale or merger of the company, (ii) sell Series B Preferred with rights senior to or on parity with the Series A, (iii) et cetera…”

To understand why investors want protective provisions, you first need to understand how the preferred and common classes control the company.

The common and preferred classes control the company through

After the common and preferred classes select their representatives on the board, the board takes it from there. The board, not the shareholders, usually approve management decisions. (We previously showed you how to hack the allocation of seats on the board.)

However, some major actions require shareholder votes and class votes in addition to board votes. For example, Delaware corporations require a shareholder vote to sell the company or raise money.

The preferred usually owns 20%-40% of the company after the Series A. If the common is united, the preferred can’t influence shareholder votes—they don’t own enough shares. Nor can they influence board votes if a united common controls the board (e.g., the board consists of two common seats, one preferred seat, and no independents).

If the common controls a Delaware corporation’s stock and board, the preferred need protective provisions to stop the common from:

Protective provisions protect the Series A minority from unfair actions by the common majority. That’s why they’re called protective provisions. In future rounds, protective provisions can also protect each series of preferred stock from the other series of preferred stock.

Some investors claim that they need protective provisions because they can’t use their board seat to serve their own interests. They correctly argue that board members have to serve the interests of the company as a whole, not the interests of their class of stock.

These investors will claim that protective provisions let them serve their interests as investors, so they can serve the interests of the company through their board seat:

Say the company receives an offer to acquire the business. Management thinks it’s in the company’s interest to sell. The board defers to management since management is doing a good job running the company. But the investors think the company is the home run in their portfolio—they don’t want to sell the company now. So the investors use their board seat to vote for the sale and use their protective provisions to veto the sale.

We don’t agree that investors need protective provisions to serve on the board without succumbing to their own interests.

In fact, any investor who makes that argument is raising a big red flag. They’re implying that they can’t fulfill their duty as board members without additional veto powers. They’re implying that the interests of their fund can outweigh the interests of the company.

Your response to this argument goes like this:

“I don’t think you mean that you can’t serve the interests of the company without these additional protective provisions. I’m sure you will use your board seat to do the right thing for the company, always.

“You control the company through (1) board votes where you serve the interest of the company and (2) share and class votes where you serve your own interests.

“Protective provisions protect you against the common majority. But they’re not a tool to serve the interests of your fund at the expense of the company.”



We would rather have an “evil” investor who uses his board seat to serve his interests, than an investor who planned to use protective provisions to do anything other than protect himself. At least the “evil” investor’s power as a board member is in proportion to his share of board seats—his protective provisions give him a blanket veto that is wildly out of proportion with his ownership of stock and allocation of board seats!

The next few hacks will show you how to attenuate the protective provisions, reduce this mis-alignment, and leave enough protective provisions in place to protect the preferred.

"# Why startups should train their people

Ben Horowitz:

“Training is, quite simply, one of the highest-leverage activities a manger can perform. Consider for a moment the possibility of your putting on a series of four lectures for members of your department. Let’s count on three hours preparation for each hour of course time—twelve hours of work in total. Say that you have ten students in your class. Next year they will work a total of about twenty thousand hours for your organization. If your training efforts result in a 1 percent improvement in you subordinates’ performance, you company will gain the equivalent of two hundred hours of work as the result of the expenditure of your twelve hours…

“When people interview managers, they often like to ask: have you fired anyone? Or how many people have you fired? Or how would you go about firing someone? These are all fine questions, but often the right question is the one that isn’t asked: When you fired the person, how did you know with certainty that the employee both understood the expectations of the job and were missing them? The best answer is that the manager clearly set expectations when she trained the employee for the job. If you don’t train your people, you establish no basis for performance management. As a result, performance management in your company will be sloppy and inconsistent…

“Andy Grove writes, there are only two ways for a manager to improve the output of an employee: motivation and training.”
