    "query": "what are the different kinds of pivots one should consider for a startup?",
    "query_results": "Eric Ries: Technology Pivot: A PIVOT IS A STRATEGIC HYPOTHESIS Although the pivots identified above will be familiar to students of business strategy, the ability to pivot is no substitute for sound strategic thinking. The problem with providing famous examples of pivots is that most people are familiar only with the successful end strategies of famous companies. Most readers know that Southwest or Walmart is an example of a low-cost disruption in their markets, that Microsoft an example of a platform monopoly, and that Starbucks has leveraged a powerful premium brand. What is generally less well known are the pivots that were required to discover those strategies. Companies have a strong incentive to align their PR stories around the heroic founder and make it seem that their success was the inevitable result of a good idea. Thus, although startups often pivot into a strategy that seems similar to that of a successful company, it is important not to put too much stock in these analogies. It\u2019s extremely difficult to know if the analogy has been drawn properly. Have we copied the essential features or just superficial ones? Will what worked in that industry work in ours? Will what has worked in the past work today? A pivot is better understood as a new strategic hypothesis that will require a new minimum viable product to test. Pivots are a permanent fact of life for any growing business. Even after a company achieves initial success, it must continue to pivot. Those familiar with the technology life cycle ideas of theorists such as Geoffrey Moore know certain later-stage pivots by the names he has given them: the Chasm, the Tornado, the Bowling Alley. Readers of the disruptive innovation literature spearheaded by Harvard\u2019s Clayton Christensen will be familiar with established companies that fail to pivot when they should. The critical skill for managers today is to match those theories to their present situation so that they apply the right advice at the right time. Modern managers cannot have escaped the deluge of recent books calling on them to adapt, change, reinvent, or upend their existing businesses. Many of the works in this category are long on exhortations and short on specifics. A pivot is not just an exhortation to change. Remember, it is a special kind of structured change designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model, and engine of growth. It is the heart of the Lean Startup method. It is what makes the companies that follow Lean Startup resilient in the face of mistakes: if we take a wrong turn, we have the tools we need to realize it and the agility to find another path. In Part Two, we have looked at a startup idea from its initial leaps of faith, tested it with a minimum viable product, used innovation accounting and actionable metrics to evaluate the results, and made the decision to pivot or persevere. I have treated these subjects in great detail to prepare for what comes next. On the page, these processes may seem clinical, slow, and simple. In the real world, something different is needed. We have learned to steer when moving slowly. Now we must learn to race. Laying a solid foundation is only the first step toward our real destination: acceleration. \nEric Ries: MAKE: The decision to pivot requires a clear-eyed and objective mind-set. We\u2019ve discussed the telltale signs of the need to pivot: the decreasing effectiveness of product experiments and the general feeling that product development should be more productive. Whenever you see those symptoms, consider a pivot. The decision to pivot is emotionally charged for any startup and has to be addressed in a structured way. One way to mitigate this challenge is to schedule the meeting in advance. I recommend that every startup have a regular \u201cpivot or persevere\u201d meeting. In my experience, less than a few weeks between meetings is too often and more than a few months is too infrequent. However, each startup needs to find its own pace. Each pivot or persevere meeting requires the participation of both the product development and business leadership teams. At IMVU, we also added the perspectives of outside advisers who could help us see past our preconceptions and interpret data in new ways. The product development team must bring a complete report of the results of its product optimization efforts over time (not just the past period) as well as a comparison of how those results stack up against expectations (again, over time). The business leadership should bring detailed accounts of their conversations with current and potential customers. Let\u2019s take a look at this process in action in a dramatic pivot done by a company called Wealthfront. That company was founded in 2007 by Dan Carroll and added Andy Rachleff as CEO shortly thereafter. Andy is a well-known figure in Silicon Valley: he is a cofounder and former general partner of the venture capital firm Benchmark Capital and is on the faculty of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he teaches a variety of courses on technology entrepreneurship. I first met Andy when he commissioned a case study on IMVU to teach his students about the process we had used to build the company. Wealthfront\u2019s mission is to disrupt the mutual fund industry by bringing greater transparency, access, and value to retail investors. What makes Wealthfront\u2019s story unusual, however, is not where it is today but how it began: as an online game. In Wealthfront\u2019s original incarnation it was called kaChing and was conceived as a kind of fantasy league for amateur investors. It allowed anyone to open a virtual trading account and build a portfolio that was based on real market data without having to invest real money. The idea was to identify diamonds in the rough: amateur traders who lacked the resources to become fund managers but who possessed market insight. Wealthfront\u2019s founders did not want to be in the online gaming business per se; kaChing was part of a sophisticated strategy in the service of their larger vision. Any student of disruptive innovation would have looked on approvingly: they were following that system perfectly by initially serving customers who were unable to participate in the mainstream market. Over time, they believed, the product would become more and more sophisticated, eventually allowing users to serve (and disrupt) existing professional fund managers. To identify the best amateur trading savants, Wealthfront built sophisticated technology to rate the skill of each fund manager, using techniques employed by the most sophisticated evaluators of money managers, the premier U.S. university endowments. Those methods allowed them to evaluate not just the returns the managers generated but also the amount of risk they had taken along with how consistent they performed relative to their declared investment strategy. Thus, fund managers who achieved great returns through reckless gambles (i.e., investments outside their area of expertise) would be ranked lower than those who had figured out how to beat the market through skill.\nEric Ries: Auditable: PIVOT (OR PERSEVERE) Every entrepreneur eventually faces an overriding challenge in developing a successful product: deciding when to pivot and when to persevere. Everything that has been discussed so far is a prelude to a seemingly simple question: are we making sufficient progress to believe that our original strategic hypothesis is correct, or do we need to make a major change? That change is called a pivot: a structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth. Because of the scientific methodology that underlies the Lean Startup, there is often a misconception that it offers a rigid clinical formula for making pivot or persevere decisions. This is not true. There is no way to remove the human element\u2014vision, intuition, judgment\u2014from the practice of entrepreneurship, nor would that be desirable. My goal in advocating a scientific approach to the creation of startups is to channel human creativity into its most productive form, and there is no bigger destroyer of creative potential than the misguided decision to persevere. Companies that cannot bring themselves to pivot to a new direction on the basis of feedback from the marketplace can get stuck in the land of the living dead, neither growing enough nor dying, consuming resources and commitment from employees and other stakeholders but not moving ahead. There is good news about our reliance on judgment, though. We are able to learn, we are innately creative, and we have a remarkable ability to see the signal in the noise. In fact, we are so good at this that sometimes we see signals that aren\u2019t there. The heart of the scientific method is the realization that although human judgment may be faulty, we can improve our judgment by subjecting our theories to repeated testing. Startup productivity is not about cranking out more widgets or features. It is about aligning our efforts with a business and product that are working to create value and drive growth. In other words, successful pivots put us on a path toward growing a sustainable business. INNOVATION ACCOUNTING LEADS TO FASTER PIVOTS\nEric Ries: Technology Pivot: As we\u2019ll see in Chapter 10, there are three primary engines of growth that power startups: the viral, sticky, and paid growth models. In this type of pivot, a company changes its growth strategy to seek faster or more profitable growth. Commonly but not always, the engine of growth also requires a change in the way value is captured. Channel Pivot. In traditional sales terminology, the mechanism by which a company delivers its product to customers is called the sales channel or distribution channel. For example, consumer packaged goods are sold in a grocery store, cars are sold in dealerships, and much enterprise software is sold (with extensive customization) by consulting and professional services firms. Often, the requirements of the channel determine the price, features, and competitive landscape of a product. A channel pivot is a recognition that the same basic solution could be delivered through a different channel with greater effectiveness. Whenever a company abandons a previously complex sales process to \u201csell direct\u201d to its end users, a channel pivot is in progress. It is precisely because of its destructive effect on sales channels that the Internet has had such a disruptive influence in industries that previously required complex sales and distribution channels, such as newspaper, magazine, and book publishing. Occasionally, a company discovers a way to achieve the same solution by using a completely different technology. Technology pivots are much more common in established businesses. In other words, they are a sustaining innovation, an incremental improvement designed to appeal to and retain an existing customer base. Established companies excel at this kind of pivot because so much is not changing. The customer segment is the same, the customer\u2019s problem is the same, the value-capture model is the same, and the channel partners are the same. The only question is whether the new technology can provide superior price and/or performance compared with the existing technology. \nEric Ries: Value Capture Pivot: Pivots come in different flavors. The word pivot sometimes is used incorrectly as a synonym for change. A pivot is a special kind of change designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model, and engine of growth. Zoom-in Pivot In this case, what previously was considered a single feature in a product becomes the whole product. This is the type of pivot Votizen made when it pivoted away from a full social network and toward a simple voter contact product. Zoom-out Pivot In the reverse situation, sometimes a single feature is insufficient to support a whole product. In this type of pivot, what was considered the whole product becomes a single feature of a much larger product. In this pivot, the company realizes that the product it is building solves a real problem for real customers but that they are not the type of customers it originally planned to serve. In other words, the product hypothesis is partially confirmed, solving the right problem, but for a different customer than originally anticipated. As a result of getting to know customers extremely well, it sometimes becomes clear that the problem we\u2019re trying to solve for them is not very important. However, because of this customer intimacy, we often discover other related problems that are important and can be solved by our team. In many cases, these related problems may require little more than repositioning the existing product. In other cases, it may require a completely new product. Again, this a case where the product hypothesis is partially confirmed; the target customer has a problem worth solving, just not the one that was originally anticipated. A famous example is the chain Potbelly Sandwich Shop, which today has over two hundred stores. It began as an antique store in 1977; the owners started to sell sandwiches as a way to bolster traffic to their stores. Pretty soon they had pivoted their way into an entirely different line of business. A platform pivot refers to a change from an application to a platform or vice versa. Most commonly, startups that aspire to create a new platform begin life by selling a single application, the so-called killer app, for their platform. Only later does the platform emerge as a vehicle for third parties to leverage as a way to create their own related products. However, this order is not always set in stone, and some companies have to execute this pivot multiple times. This pivot borrows a concept from Geoffrey Moore, who observed that companies generally follow one of two major business architectures: high margin, low volume (complex systems model) or low margin, high volume (volume operations model). 6 The former commonly is associated with business to business (B2B) or enterprise sales cycles, and the latter with consumer products (there are notable exceptions). In a business architecture pivot, a startup switches architectures. Some companies change from high margin, low volume by going mass market (e.g., Google\u2019s search \u201cappliance\u201d); others, originally designed for the mass market, turned out to require long and expensive sales cycles. There are many ways to capture the value a company creates. These methods are referred to commonly as monetization or revenue models. These terms are much too limiting. Implicit in the idea of monetization is that it is a separate \u201cfeature\u201d of a product that can be added or removed at will. In reality, capturing value is an intrinsic part of the product hypothesis. Often, changes to the way a company captures value can have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the business, product, and marketing strategies.",

As a result of getting to know customers extremely well, it sometimes becomes clear that the problem we\u2019re trying to solve for them is not very important. However, because of this customer intimacy, we often discover other related problems that are important and can be solved by our team. In many cases, these related problems may require little more than repositioning the existing product. In other cases, it may require a completely new product. Again, this a case where the product hypothesis is partially confirmed; the target customer has a problem worth solving, just not the one that was originally anticipated. A famous example is the chain Potbelly Sandwich Shop, which today has over two hundred stores. It began as an antique store in 1977; the owners started to sell sandwiches as a way to bolster traffic to their stores. Pretty soon they had pivoted their way into an entirely different line of business. A platform pivot refers to a change from an application to a platform or vice versa. Most commonly, startups that aspire to create a new platform begin life by selling a single application, the so-called killer app, for their platform. Only later does the platform emerge as a vehicle for third parties to leverage as a way to create their own related products. However, this order is not always set in stone, and some companies have to execute this pivot multiple times. This pivot borrows a concept from Geoffrey Moore, who observed that companies generally follow one of two major business architectures: high margin, low volume (complex systems model) or low margin, high volume (volume operations model). 6 The former commonly is associated with business to business (B2B) or enterprise sales cycles, and the latter with consumer products (there are notable exceptions). In a business architecture pivot, a startup switches architectures. Some companies change from high margin, low volume by going mass market (e.g., Google\u2019s search \u201cappliance\u201d); others, originally designed for the mass market, turned out to require long and expensive sales cycles. There are many ways to capture the value a company creates. These methods are referred to commonly as monetization or revenue models. These terms are much too limiting. Implicit in the idea of monetization is that it is a separate \u201cfeature\u201d of a product that can be added or removed at will. In reality, capturing value is an intrinsic part of the product hypothesis. Often, changes to the way a company captures value can have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the business, product, and marketing strategies.\n\nQ: what are the different kinds of pivots one should consider for a startup?\nA:",

    "query_results": "Ben Horowitz: So you've achieved product market fit and you are ready to start building the company. The board encourages you to bring in some been there, done that executives who will provide the right financial, sales, and marketing expertise to help you transition from a world-class product to a world-class business. You see a few candidates that you like, but the venture capitalist on the board says, You are undershooting. This is going to be a huge company. We can attract better talent. So you aim high and bring in a super-accomplished head of sales. This guy has run huge organizations with thousands of employees. He has stellar references and even looks the part. Your VC loves him, because he has an awesome r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9.\nElad Gil: Removing members from your board|Removing VC board members|Once they join your board as part of a financing, investor board members are notoriously hard to get rid of, as they usually have contractual rights to the board seat written in their financing documents (i.e., your series A, or series B, C, etc., paperwork). 1\nRemoving a VC board member can generally only happen at a time of transition or leverage (a financing event, major change in company direction, IPO, etc). Additionally, the VC may have extra economics in the investment for taking the board seat, or view the seat as something that builds her stature in the broader world. So how do you get rid of a misbehaving board member? There are a few tactics you can try, depending on the stage of your company, the leverage you have as an entrepreneur, and your relationship to the VC and her firm.\n1. Change the overall composition of the board to reflect the maturation of the company (and boot the VC off as part of this shift). The makeup of your board should change as the company scales from a young organization seeking to develop a meaningful product to a more mature startup in high-growth mode. At the early stages, board members may be valuable in your quest for product/market fit or your next round of funding. For example, board members may know of new distribution tactics or other strategies that are working in their portfolios, which they can share with you (e.g., \"Facebook is suddenly working well for mobile app distribution\"). However, if they lack operating experience, a network of potential later-stage executive hires, or broader strategic insights, it might make sense to replace them and other board members as your company starts to scale rapidly.\nOnce a company finds product/market fit and focuses on scaling, the skill set, network, and advice needed from a board member shifts as well. Similarly, as a company starts to plan to go public it will need to add more independent directors and more operators, as well as more specialized board members (e.g., a former CFO for the finance/audit committee).\n\"Once a company finds product/market fit and focuses on scaling, the skill set, network and advice needed from a board members shifts as well.\"\n- Elad Gil\nWhen shifting into high-growth mode, you can ask multiple early board members to step off the board to help enable the transition to a successful later-stage or public company. This approach prevents any one request from being viewed as a personal criticism of any one board member--rather, you are changing the slate as the company matures. If an early board member can be especially helpful in your later stages, you can retain this board member or alternatively convert her to an independent seat.\nWhile the request to step down as the company matures may be a logical one that should increase the value of the company overall, some may refuse--because they benefit from the stature of being on your board, for example, or want to protect their investment in your company until the company has a liquidity event. But if one or more of the other board members step down as part of an overall reshuffle, it puts pressure on the holdouts to comply as well.\nAlternatively, as a later-stage funding round occurs you can ask an early investor to step down so that you can create a seat for a later-stage investor. Many early-stage investors may refuse. However, you can point out that the investor coming in brings new and necessary skills, networks, or advice to the table. Remind existing members that there is a need to keep the board to a constrained size and also to start planning toward an IPO (assuming one is in sight in 18 months or less).\nIn general, simply asking an investor board member to step down is unlikely to work.\n2. Buy them out. It takes 5-10 years for most companies to have a liquidity event. Many investors will be raising additional funds from their own limited partners (LPs) along the way, and they'll want to show a return to get the LPs to invest more in those future funds. This means you can offer VC board members an opportunity to sell a subset of their stake in your company in exchange for stepping off the board. This stock sale could happen either via a secondary event (see the chapter on late-stage financings) or as part of a later-stage primary funding round. If the investor does want to sell stock prior to a full liquidity event such as an IPO, you can make the following arguments for why a stock sale should be tied to her stepping off the board:\n3. Ask the VC firm to swap out your board member for another partner from their firm. This tends to work only if your company is working really well and the firm wants to maintain a positive relationship with you over time as the founder of a breakout company. Unless the VC partner you are trying to remove controls the whole firm, the firm may agree to swap out your board member for another one to maintain warm ties with you. (Thanks to Reid Hoffman for this insight.)\nThese conversations, by the way, can be very tough and very emotional. VC board members are humans too, and they may have a lot of ego or emotion wrapped up in a successful company. Even if they have done nothing to help the company beyond capital (and capital is indeed helpful), your VCs may still feel that they fundamentally contributed to the company's success. When making your case that they should step down, be firm, calm, and consistent.\nBen Horowitz: The other day I was talking to a couple of friends of mine, one a VC and the other a CEO. During the meeting, we discussed one of the executives at the CEO's company. The executive in question performs exceptionally but lacks experience managing at larger scale. My friend the VC innocently advised the CEO to carefully consider whether the executive would scale to meet the company's needs in the future. I responded swiftly, aggressively, and loudly, saying, That's a horrible idea and makes no sense at all. Both of my friends were startled at my outburst. Normally I am disciplined enough to refrain from letting my feelings pass straight through my mouth without stopping at my brain for review. Why the outburst? Here is my answer.\nElad Gil: How to evaluate late-stage funding sources|Key Terms|Late-stage financings are not that different from earlier-stage rounds for the key terms to consider. However, at the later stages the two most important items you'll weigh tend to collapse down to preference and board membership.\nPreference. While top-tier early-stage investors tend to have a clean preference structure (i.e., non-participating preferred 1), private equity firms and family offices may ask for unusual preference structures that effectively convert an equity round into a debt round. For example, if the company and investor cannot agree on valuation, the private equity fund may ask for a 2X or 3X preference, as well as a ratchet on the next round. Similarly, later-stage investors may put in special provisions around IPOs (e.g., if the IPO prices under a certain valuation, or takes longer than six to nine months, the investor gets extra stock), future fundraises, or other aspects of the company's life cycle. In general, you should avoid these special terms if you can, although you may not have the chance to do so, especially if your valuation starts to exceed your core business metrics or capital is scarce.\nBoard membership. As with all financings, a key element to think through is whether or not to add a board member as part of the round. In general, larger boards are harder to manage. However, late-stage investors may bring a perspective to the board that has been lacking up to this point--around financial discipline, for example, or the state of the public market. This perspective can be helpful or destructive, depending on the board member and broader company context. On average, later-stage investors will be more numbers/revenue/margin driven, and this can drive a company down either a very good or a very bad path.\nAdditionally, later-stage investors may not be as used to dealing with the many \"oh shit\" moments that a startup typically faces in a rapidly evolving market, with a shifting product road map, and a changing org structure. Some late-stage investors are notoriously hands-off/founder-friendly (e.g., Yuri Milner and DST).

The board encourages you to bring in some been there, done that executives who will provide the right financial, sales, and marketing expertise to help you transition from a world-class product to a world-class business. You see a few candidates that you like, but the venture capitalist on the board says, You are undershooting. This is going to be a huge company. We can attract better talent. So you aim high and bring in a super-accomplished head of sales. This guy has run huge organizations with thousands of employees. He has stellar references and even looks the part. Your VC loves him, because he has an awesome r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9.\nElad Gil: Removing members from your board|Removing VC board members|Once they join your board as part of a financing, investor board members are notoriously hard to get rid of, as they usually have contractual rights to the board seat written in their financing documents (i.e., your series A, or series B, C, etc., paperwork). 1\nRemoving a VC board member can generally only happen at a time of transition or leverage (a financing event, major change in company direction, IPO, etc). Additionally, the VC may have extra economics in the investment for taking the board seat, or view the seat as something that builds her stature in the broader world. So how do you get rid of a misbehaving board member? There are a few tactics you can try, depending on the stage of your company, the leverage you have as an entrepreneur, and your relationship to the VC and her firm.\n1. Change the overall composition of the board to reflect the maturation of the company (and boot the VC off as part of this shift). The makeup of your board should change as the company scales from a young organization seeking to develop a meaningful product to a more mature startup in high-growth mode. At the early stages, board members may be valuable in your quest for product/market fit or your next round of funding. For example, board members may know of new distribution tactics or other strategies that are working in their portfolios, which they can share with you (e.g., \"Facebook is suddenly working well for mobile app distribution\"). However, if they lack operating experience, a network of potential later-stage executive hires, or broader strategic insights, it might make sense to replace them and other board members as your company starts to scale rapidly.\nOnce a company finds product/market fit and focuses on scaling, the skill set, network, and advice needed from a board member shifts as well. Similarly, as a company starts to plan to go public it will need to add more independent directors and more operators, as well as more specialized board members (e.g., a former CFO for the finance/audit committee).\n\"Once a company finds product/market fit and focuses on scaling, the skill set, network and advice needed from a board members shifts as well.\"\n- Elad Gil\nWhen shifting into high-growth mode, you can ask multiple early board members to step off the board to help enable the transition to a successful later-stage or public company. This approach prevents any one request from being viewed as a personal criticism of any one board member--rather, you are changing the slate as the company matures. If an early board member can be especially helpful in your later stages, you can retain this board member or alternatively convert her to an independent seat.\nWhile the request to step down as the company matures may be a logical one that should increase the value of the company overall, some may refuse--because they benefit from the stature of being on your board, for example, or want to protect their investment in your company until the company has a liquidity event. But if one or more of the other board members step down as part of an overall reshuffle, it puts pressure on the holdouts to comply as well.\nAlternatively, as a later-stage funding round occurs you can ask an early investor to step down so that you can create a seat for a later-stage investor. Many early-stage investors may refuse. However, you can point out that the investor coming in brings new and necessary skills, networks, or advice to the table. Remind existing members that there is a need to keep the board to a constrained size and also to start planning toward an IPO (assuming one is in sight in 18 months or less).\nIn general, simply asking an investor board member to step down is unlikely to work.\n2. Buy them out. It takes 5-10 years for most companies to have a liquidity event. Many investors will be raising additional funds from their own limited partners (LPs) along the way, and they'll want to show a return to get the LPs to invest more in those future funds. This means you can offer VC board members an opportunity to sell a subset of their stake in your company in exchange for stepping off the board. This stock sale could happen either via a secondary event (see the chapter on late-stage financings) or as part of a later-stage primary funding round. If the investor does want to sell stock prior to a full liquidity event such as an IPO, you can make the following arguments for why a stock sale should be tied to her stepping off the board:\n3. Ask the VC firm to swap out your board member for another partner from their firm. This tends to work only if your company is working really well and the firm wants to maintain a positive relationship with you over time as the founder of a breakout company. Unless the VC partner you are trying to remove controls the whole firm, the firm may agree to swap out your board member for another one to maintain warm ties with you. (Thanks to Reid Hoffman for this insight.)\nThese conversations, by the way, can be very tough and very emotional. VC board members are humans too, and they may have a lot of ego or emotion wrapped up in a successful company. Even if they have done nothing to help the company beyond capital (and capital is indeed helpful), your VCs may still feel that they fundamentally contributed to the company's success. When making your case that they should step down, be firm, calm, and consistent.\nBen Horowitz: The other day I was talking to a couple of friends of mine, one a VC and the other a CEO. During the meeting, we discussed one of the executives at the CEO's company. The executive in question performs exceptionally but lacks experience managing at larger scale. My friend the VC innocently advised the CEO to carefully consider whether the executive would scale to meet the company's needs in the future. I responded swiftly, aggressively, and loudly, saying, That's a horrible idea and makes no sense at all. Both of my friends were startled at my outburst. Normally I am disciplined enough to refrain from letting my feelings pass straight through my mouth without stopping at my brain for review. Why the outburst? Here is my answer.\nElad Gil: How to evaluate late-stage funding sources|Key Terms|Late-stage financings are not that different from earlier-stage rounds for the key terms to consider. However, at the later stages the two most important items you'll weigh tend to collapse down to preference and board membership.\nPreference. While top-tier early-stage investors tend to have a clean preference structure (i.e., non-participating preferred 1), private equity firms and family offices may ask for unusual preference structures that effectively convert an equity round into a debt round. For example, if the company and investor cannot agree on valuation, the private equity fund may ask for a 2X or 3X preference, as well as a ratchet on the next round. Similarly, later-stage investors may put in special provisions around IPOs (e.g., if the IPO prices under a certain valuation, or takes longer than six to nine months, the investor gets extra stock), future fundraises, or other aspects of the company's life cycle. In general, you should avoid these special terms if you can, although you may not have the chance to do so, especially if your valuation starts to exceed your core business metrics or capital is scarce.\nBoard membership. As with all financings, a key element to think through is whether or not to add a board member as part of the round. In general, larger boards are harder to manage. However, late-stage investors may bring a perspective to the board that has been lacking up to this point--around financial discipline, for example, or the state of the public market. This perspective can be helpful or destructive, depending on the board member and broader company context. On average, later-stage investors will be more numbers/revenue/margin driven, and this can drive a company down either a very good or a very bad path.\nAdditionally, later-stage investors may not be as used to dealing with the many \"oh shit\" moments that a startup typically faces in a rapidly evolving market, with a shifting product road map, and a changing org structure. Some late-stage investors are notoriously hands-off/founder-friendly (e.g., Yuri Milner and DST). However, many are used to \"safer\" late-stage investments and can cause trouble for a high-growth startup that's still rapidly evolving.\nChoose your board members carefully! And consider avoiding new additions altogether, unless your late-stage investors can help in unique ways. Depending on the dynamics around your fundraise, you may not have a choice--e.g., if the investor requires a board seat and you do not have a good alternative option.\nBefore adding anyone as a board member, make sure to (1) do due diligence on her past investments and board seats; (2) have frank conversations about company direction and expectations; and (3) decide if there are other ways to give late-stage investors meaningful impact and access to company information--without adding a board seat.

Whatever your views on thermodynamics: MONOPOLY CAPITALISM: Monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate. Then monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can\u2019t dream of.

Before that, IBM\u2019s hardware monopoly of the \u201960s and \u201970s was overtaken by Microsoft\u2019s software monopoly. AT&T had a monopoly on telephone service for most of the 20th century, but now anyone can get a cheap cell phone plan from any number of providers. If the tendency of monopoly businesses were to hold back progress, they would be dangerous and we\u2019d be right to oppose them.

However, analyzing your business according to these characteristics can help you think about how to make it durable. As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. Anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell, especially in an already crowded market. The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. If you build something valuable where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite. A drug to safely eliminate the need for sleep, or a cure for baldness, for example, would certainly support a monopoly business.\nPeter Thiel: CHARACTERISTICS OF MONOPOLY: Paradoxically, then, network effects businesses must start with especially small markets. Facebook started with just Harvard students\u2014Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s first product was designed to get all his classmates signed up, not to attract all people of Earth. This is why successful network businesses rarely get started by MBA types: the initial markets are so small that they often don\u2019t even appear to be business opportunities at all. Many businesses gain only limited advantages as they grow to large scale. Service businesses especially are difficult to make monopolies. If you own a yoga studio, for example, you\u2019ll only be able to serve a certain number of customers. You can hire more instructors and expand to more locations, but your margins will remain fairly low and you\u2019ll never reach a point where a core group of talented people can provide something of value to millions of separate clients, as software engineers are able to do.\nand marketing the iPhone were the reward for creating greater abundance: MONOPOLY CAPITALISM: In a static world, a monopolist is just a rent collector. If you corner the market for something, you can jack up the price; others will have no choice but to buy from you. Think of the famous board game: deeds are shuffled around from player to player, but the board never changes. There\u2019s no way to win by inventing a better kind of real estate development. The relative values of the properties are fixed for all time, so all you can do is try to buy them up. But the world we live in is dynamic: it\u2019s possible to invent new and better things.

    "query_results": "Elad Gil: Hiring executives|Traits to look for in executives|First-time founders or CEOs typically find it hard to hire the first executives to join the team. As a founder, often without deep work experience, you have pulled off the impossible and created a product or service lots of people want to use or pay for. And you did so without any fancy executive-type people from Google or Facebook, with their expensive paychecks and reliance on process.\nAt some point, however, you will notice that lots of things start to break down. Communication within the company gets gummed up. Various product teams start to lose coordination. You don't have time to get every important thing done in the day, and indeed you start to run out of time to think. Your hiring process falls apart, and it takes weeks for you to follow up with candidates. Your sales pipeline is largely dependent on you and a handful of inexperienced individual contributors--and suddenly follow-through crashes to a halt. You may try to promote existing employees (who also have no prior experience) to run various areas, and in most cases this fails or does not really help anything.\nSuddenly you realize that you really need someone with more experience on your team.\nHiring executives for the first time can be quite tricky for a founder. However, once you hire your first seasoned exec who works out, you will be grateful for her presence. All sorts of things will magically just get done. People will get hired, deals will get closed, process will tighten up. It can be a wondrous experience. You will kick yourself for not hiring an experienced, high-capacity executive sooner.\n\"Once you hire your first seasoned exec who works out, you will be grateful for her presence. All sorts of things will magically get done. People will get hired, deals will get closed, process will tighten up. It can be a wondrous experience.\"\n- Elad Gil\nUnfortunately, things could also go badly. The executive is a bad culture fit, or is too senior for the role and spins his wheels. Time is wasted and progress lost on a poor fit--or even worse, some of the best people on your team quit when managed by someone who's not working out.\nFinding a great executive for your company can be challenging, but it's well worth the effort. And there are some steps you can take to maximize your chances of success:\nBen Horowitz: If you build a great product and the market wants it, you will find yourself needing to grow your company extremely quickly. Nothing will ensure your success like hiring the right executive who has grown an organization like yours very quickly and successfully before. Note that this is not the same as inheriting a very large organization or working your way up to running a very large organization. Make sure you hire the right kind of fast-growth executive. Also, do not hire this person if you are not ready to give them lots of budget to grow their organization; expect them to do what they do. The successful fast-growth executive is so important to building successful startups that recruiters and venture capitalists often advise CEOs to bring them in before the company is ready.\nElad Gil: Hiring executives|Define the role & meet with people who do it well|Most of the time, a founder will have no idea what to look for when hiring someone to run a particular company function. What does a CFO, general counsel, or even VP of sales really do day-to-day? How can you spot someone who is exceptional at each role? What characteristics should one type of VP have versus another? For example, how does a VP of engineering differ from a VP of sales, or even a CFO?\nIf you want to learn more about what a great CFO or VP of engineering does, your best bet is to reach out to people who are great at these roles and ask them for advice. Your investors or mentors may be able to suggest which companies have the best people for each function. For example, if you are hiring a CFO, go and meet three or four great CFOs at companies a few years ahead of yours or larger public companies known for excellence like Google or Netflix. What would they hire for in a CFO? What traits would they look for? What interview questions, work projects, tests, reference-checking questions, or other approaches would they take to vet a candidate in this area? For your company size and 18-month growth road map, what should you look for?\nIn order to get in touch with great leaders in finance, sales, engineering, and more, ask your investors or advisors for introductions. Or, you can ask the founders of other companies that are a few years ahead of you to introduce you to their CFOs or VPs of product for advice and perhaps candidate suggestions.\nOnce you have figured out what you want in the role, write it down and share it with the team that will be interviewing candidates for that executive hire. You want everyone to have a common view of what to look for, as well as what to select against. You can also use this as an opportunity to reemphasize the cultural characteristics the candidate must embody. Clearly establishing what you are hiring for will make a huge difference as you collect your team's feedback and discuss candidates. It will also prevent poor hiring (or, alternatively, rejection of a great candidate) due to a lack of common understanding of what you are looking for.\nElad Gil: Hiring executives|Traits to look for in executives|If you have a 10-person engineering team, and in 12 months it will grow to 30 people, you do not need to hire an SVP from Salesforce whose job is to manage a 1,500-person team. This person will get bored with the small job offered to her and may simply spin her wheels. She is too senior for the role.\nWhen hiring executives, look for people who have the experience and background that would make them a good fit or hire for the next 12-18 months. Anything shorter than that and they will not be able to scale sufficiently far relative to the time it takes to hire them. Anything longer and you will over-hire and end up with someone who is a bad fit for the job. Whatever the role, there are a few key skills and traits that you want your executives to bring to the table:\n1. Functional area expertise.\n2. Ability to build and manage a team in those functional areas.\n3. Collegiality.\n4. Strong communication skills.\n5. Owner mentality.\n6. Smarts and strategic thinking skills.\nBen Horowitz: Your startup is going well and as your business expands you hear the dreaded words from someone on your board: You need to hire some senior people. Some real 'been there, done that' executives to help you get the company to the next level. Really? Is now the time? If so, where do I begin? And once I get them, what do I do with them? And how will I know if they are doing a good job?",

What interview questions, work projects, tests, reference-checking questions, or other approaches would they take to vet a candidate in this area? For your company size and 18-month growth road map, what should you look for?\nIn order to get in touch with great leaders in finance, sales, engineering, and more, ask your investors or advisors for introductions. Or, you can ask the founders of other companies that are a few years ahead of you to introduce you to their CFOs or VPs of product for advice and perhaps candidate suggestions.\nOnce you have figured out what you want in the role, write it down and share it with the team that will be interviewing candidates for that executive hire. You want everyone to have a common view of what to look for, as well as what to select against. You can also use this as an opportunity to reemphasize the cultural characteristics the candidate must embody. Clearly establishing what you are hiring for will make a huge difference as you collect your team's feedback and discuss candidates. It will also prevent poor hiring (or, alternatively, rejection of a great candidate) due to a lack of common understanding of what you are looking for.\nElad Gil: Hiring executives|Traits to look for in executives|If you have a 10-person engineering team, and in 12 months it will grow to 30 people, you do not need to hire an SVP from Salesforce whose job is to manage a 1,500-person team. This person will get bored with the small job offered to her and may simply spin her wheels. She is too senior for the role.\nWhen hiring executives, look for people who have the experience and background that would make them a good fit or hire for the next 12-18 months. Anything shorter than that and they will not be able to scale sufficiently far relative to the time it takes to hire them. Anything longer and you will over-hire and end up with someone who is a bad fit for the job. Whatever the role, there are a few key skills and traits that you want your executives to bring to the table:\n1. Functional area expertise.\n2. Ability to build and manage a team in those functional areas.\n3. Collegiality.\n4. Strong communication skills.\n5. Owner mentality.\n6. Smarts and strategic thinking skills.\nBen Horowitz: Your startup is going well and as your business expands you hear the dreaded words from someone on your board: You need to hire some senior people. Some real 'been there, done that' executives to help you get the company to the next level. Really? Is now the time? If so, where do I begin? And once I get them, what do I do with them? And how will I know if they are doing a good job?\n\nQ: what tips do you have for hiring execs?\nA:",

For example, how many more users will this get us and what is the expected value per user we have?

Since they do not have a choice on where to go, paying them a little more up front discourages them from leaving your company two months later. Some of the early employees from a product or strategic buy may actually make dramatically more than this, so this is meant more as a \"worst-case\" scenario. There are two sorts of founders: those that want or need to sell and those that don't. In general, founders sell either due to fear and exhaustion (because they are tired, have run out of money, or are about to get crushed by a competitor) or conversely due to ambition and excitement (because they are excited about the impact they and their team will have, or about the financial payday).\nBen Horowitz: Based on all these factors, it made sense for us to at least consider the possibility of acquisition and run a short process to understand the interest in the M&A market.\nElad Gil: M&A: How to set a valuation for companies you buy|Valuation factors to assess for all three types of M&A|Setting the right valuation for a company you plan to acquire is more art than science. Each type of acquisition comes with its own set of considerations as you set a valuation. However, there is also a common set of things to look at when determining your willingness to pay. What is the \"target's\" cash position? If they only have 3-6 months of cash left, they will not have a lot of time to negotiate, raise more money, or find other buyers.\nHow desperate are the founders or management team to sell? Founders and management teams can get tired. Do the founders want to exit? This was famously the motivation behind Flickr's exit to Yahoo!\nIs the acquisition competitive? Who else might be bidding and what would they pay for it? If your stock is perceived as having more upside (e.g., if you are Airbnb at a $1 billion valuation), then you should be more financially convincing as an acquirer than Google (which is unlikely to increase its value by 10X again anytime soon).\nIs the acquisition defensive? Is it important that you block someone else from buying the company, so you avoid their entry into your market? For example, Google's purchase of Waze may have been in part defensive, to prevent Facebook or Apple from entering mapping well.\nHow truly unique is the target you want to buy? If you are looking to buy a mobile team and there are a dozen of them running out of money, it is a different scenario than trying to buy Instagram, which is a one-of-a-kind asset.\nElad Gil: Managing internal stakeholders|M&A|It is common for employees or executives at a company to push back on M&A. Pushing back on acquisitions may reflect a strategic or tactical insight. Alternatively, pushing back may reflect a lack of understanding or pragmatism about the inability of the company to do everything with the limited resources it has. Or, it may reflect jealousy around the acquisition price and financial outcome for the founders of the company you are buying. In general, more junior employees or company old-timers tend to push back more on M&A than experienced executives who have seen the value of doing acquisitions well at another company.\nThe set of companies you are looking to buy should be considered an internal secret and not something widely discussed with the entire company at an all-hands. This should be kept quiet because:\n1. Word may leak. This can cause a number of bad scenarios including (i) competitive bids on the startup being acquired (ii) disruption of that company's operations--for example if one of your employees tells their friend at the company that you are thinking about buying them (iii) lobbying of regulators by your competitors to block the acquisition.\n2. Most employees won't have context. Many of your employees may lack the broader strategic context, or experience, to understand how M&A may be used as a tool. They may also not understand that you may talk to ten companies but only buy one, and there is the potential for employees to get upset or worried about acquisitions that will never happen. Why cause organizational churn or questioning for no reason?\n3. It makes it harder to bid on the same company again later. If you publically try to buy something, and then publically pass, it may become harder to justify to your team another attempt on the same company. Strategic imperatives, financial models or other items may change and it is best to maintain flexibility.\n4. Members of your team may try to inappropriately block the acquisition. See below for common objections.\nElad Gil: M&A: Buying other companies|M&A|As your valuation increases, your stock may suddenly become a valuable currency with which to buy other companies. Many first-time CEOs or executive teams tend to shy away from acquisitions due to a lack of familiarity. If done right acquisitions can accelerate a company's product and hiring plan, as well as enable key strategic or defensive moves against competitors.\nWhen I was at Twitter, the M&A team reported to me. I saw firsthand both the value of M&A as a strategic tool as well as the sheer number of startups that flounder and are looking for an acquirer (the failed startups no one ever talks about).

Preface answers with the relevant initial eg AG.\n\nContext:\nElad Gil: Organizational growth is all about pragmatism|If you are growing fast, you have a different company every 6-12 months|First-time CEOs and entrepreneurs often call me to discuss how to structure their organizations. Common questions include: Should I hire a COO or not? Who should the VP marketing report to? How should I split up product and engineering? Should our international arm build out its own functions or be matrixed with U.S. headquarters?\nThere is often fear in the mind of the entrepreneur that there is a \"right\" answer to how to structure an organization--and that if she screws it up by doing the \"wrong\" thing, the implications could be disastrous. This is an incorrect perspective. Most of the time there is no \"right\" answer and org structure is really an exercise in pragmatism. That is, what is the right structure given the talent available to your company, the set of initiatives you need to pursue, and your company's 12- to 18-month time horizon?\nHere are a few key takeaways and things to keep in mind about org structure:\nElad Gil: Organizational growth is all about pragmatism|There is no right answer|Often there is no one answer to how to structure your organization. Rather, it is a series of trade-offs. Two different structures may be equally \"good\" and \"bad.\" Don't sweat it too much--ultimately if you make a mistake, it will be painful but you can undo it.\nCommunicate to the team that as your company grows quickly, things will shift around. Make it clear that it is normal for that to happen--it's a sign of your success-- and that other companies that grow fast do the same thing.\nElad Gil: Organizational growth is all about pragmatism|Org structure is often about tie-breaking|Reporting chains are ultimately about decision-making. For example, there is a natural tension between engineering and product management, so where do you want most decisions to be taken if the two groups disagree? The person who both functions report to ultimately functions as the tie-breaker between the orgs. This is a good heuristic to keep in mind when thinking about org structure.\nElad Gil: Organizational growth is all about pragmatism|Sometimes bandwidth matters more than perfect fit|Executive bandwidth may be more important than a traditional reporting chain. For example, Alex Macgillivray, the talented former general counsel at Twitter, had user support, trust and safety, corporate development/M&A, and other areas reporting to him at various times, in addition to legal. Many of these departments normally would not report to a GC, but Alex was talented enough to take on more in the absence of other executives with bandwidth to own these areas. As new executives were hired or promoted, things then transferred over to them from Alex.\nAs CEO, you should look at your team and allocate functional areas based in part on who has the time and skill set to focus on and make that area succeed. This does not mean the chosen executive needs to manage that area forever. Remember, nothing needs to be permanent. There are also some cases that don't make sense from a tie-breaking or skill set perspective--e.g., your VP engineering should probably not run sales in addition to engineering. However, if needed, your VP engineering could potentially manage the design or product teams in the short term or, if it makes sense to do so, even longer term.\nElad Gil: Organizational growth is all about pragmatism|If you are growing fast, you have a different company every 6-12 months|When I joined Google, it grew from around 1,500 to 15,000 people in three-and-a-half years. After my startup was acquired by Twitter, Twitter grew from about 90 to 1,500 people in less than three years. A company that grows that rapidly is literally a different company every six months. This means that every 6-12 months the company's org structure may change.\nWhen choosing an organizational structure for your high-growth startup, focus on the next 6-12 months. Don't try to find the \"long-term\" solution, as in the long term your company will be completely different and have radically different needs. Eventually, your executive team will start to stabilize but the teams under them will have more frequent re-orgs as each organization ramps in size.\n\"Eventually, your executive team will start to stabilize but the teams under them will have more frequent re-orgs as each organization ramps in size.\"\n- Elad Gil\n\nQ: how can i think about direct reports and org structure for growth?\nA:",

    "query_results": "Elad Gil: M&A: How to set a valuation for companies you buy|Valuation factors to assess for all three types of M&A|Setting the right valuation for a company you plan to acquire is more art than science. Each type of acquisition comes with its own set of considerations as you set a valuation. However, there is also a common set of things to look at when determining your willingness to pay. What is the \"target's\" cash position? If they only have 3-6 months of cash left, they will not have a lot of time to negotiate, raise more money, or find other buyers.\nHow desperate are the founders or management team to sell? Founders and management teams can get tired. Do the founders want to exit? This was famously the motivation behind Flickr's exit to Yahoo!\nIs the acquisition competitive? Who else might be bidding and what would they pay for it? If your stock is perceived as having more upside (e.g., if you are Airbnb at a $1 billion valuation), then you should be more financially convincing as an acquirer than Google (which is unlikely to increase its value by 10X again anytime soon).\nIs the acquisition defensive? Is it important that you block someone else from buying the company, so you avoid their entry into your market? For example, Google's purchase of Waze may have been in part defensive, to prevent Facebook or Apple from entering mapping well.\nHow truly unique is the target you want to buy? If you are looking to buy a mobile team and there are a dozen of them running out of money, it is a different scenario than trying to buy Instagram, which is a one-of-a-kind asset.\nElad Gil: Don't over-optimize your valuation|Valuation|A common temptation for founders is to raise money at the highest possible valuation. High valuations may help with employee recruitment and compensation, generate positive PR for a company, provide ammunition for M&A, and stoke founder egos. Unfortunately, too high a valuation can lead to a host of problems down the line. For example, for many of the unicorn companies, their ability to raise their next round has less to do with whether they are viable businesses, and more to do with the valuation at which they previously raised money. 1\nToo high a valuation relative to the overall market can cause the following issues:\n 1. Follow on fundraises become hard. Investors typically expect a 2-3X increase in valuation with each round. At very high valuations (e.g., billions) this decreases to a 50%-100% markup with each round. Nonetheless, adding $1 billion in market cap is actually a lot of value creation (revenue, user growth, etc.). The higher the valuation, the harder it is to grow % market cap.\n2. Investor mix may shift. At high valuations the time horizons of the investors who will become involved may shift. Many of the non-traditional late stage investors who have entered private equity venture markets have a short time horizon of 18 to 24 months, and they may push for liquidity or progress in ways that may not be aligned with a company's ultimate goals.\n3. Internal pressure to hit a target valuation causes bad behavior. This is a biggie which I will mention more below: The pressure a founder puts on herself with a high valuation may distort her behavior and cause her to lead her company down the wrong path.\n4. Employee expectations. People who join the company due to the perceived value and upside of the stock will be upset if a down round occurs or the valuation does not grow in the next few years. This can also occur if the company valuation slides flat for three to four years while waiting to catch up to its valuation.\nThe above are all fundamentally issues of expectations. The higher your valuation, the higher the expectations. The worst manifestation of this is the pressure founders put on themselves when valuations are high.\nElad Gil: Secondary stock sales|$500 million to $1 billion tends to be a transition point|In general, a $500 million to $1 billion valuation is usually where founders and/or employees might start to consider selling stock. This shift in behavior is due to three factors: (1) It take two to five years to get to a $1 billion valuation. During that time life events (children, family illness, and the like) may have occurred and there is a financial need; (2) the market cap of the company is large enough that most of an individual's net worth is tied up in the company, 1% of the company may be worth $5 million or $10 million, diversifitcation starts to be meaningful. (3) Employee belief in the remaining multiple upside to the company may start to diminish. Almost all high-growth companies are chaotic and messy, and competition always increases when something is working well for a startup. Most early employees interpret this as a limit on the upside of the company, which increases their interest in selling. Moreover, the value of small amounts of stock at that valuation is sufficient to motivate employees to sell.\nBen Horowitz: When faced with the decision of whether to sell your company, there is no easy answer. However, preparing yourself intellectually and emotionally will help.\nBen Horowitz: So, the judgment that you have to make is (a) is this market really much bigger (more than an order of magnitude) than has been exploited to date? and (b) are we going to be number one?

    "query_results": "Ben Horowitz: I thought the first part would go okay, but I was worried about how the second piece of news would be received. We had to reverse split the stock to get the price per share high enough to go public. In theory, a reverse split shouldn't matter at all. Each employee owned a certain percentage of the company. The company had a total number of shares of stock. Multiply the total number of shares by the percentage, and you get the employees' share number. Cut the number of shares in half and, while employees would have half the number of shares, they'd still own the exact same percentage of the company. Nothing changed.\nElad Gil: 409A and RSUs|Selling Stock|The key balance in secondary sales is to allow for such transactions to occur without impacting a company's 409A valuation for common stock strike price. The 409A is an analysis you do to set the price for your stock options. If large, company-sanctioned common stock transactions occur at high prices, you will need to reset your common strike price upward, impacting your ability to reward employees.\nYou should talk to your legal team about the right approach to secondary sales and 409A. In addition, you should consider moving to restricted stock units (RSUs) instead of options once your valuation is over $1 billion and you are within 18-36 months of going public.\nBen Horowitz: Once you decide that you will have to lay people off, the time elapsed between making that decision and executing that decision should be as short as possible. If word leaks (which it will inevitably if you delay), then you will be faced with an additional set of issues. Employees will question managers and ask whether a layoff is coming. If the managers don't know, they will look stupid. If the managers do know, they will either have to lie to their employees, contribute to the leak, or remain silent, which will create additional agitation. At Loudcloud/Opsware, we badly mismanaged this dynamic with our first round of layoffs, but sharply corrected things on the next two.\nBen Horowitz: Fast-forward six months and everyone in the company is wondering why the sales (or marketing or finance or product) guy who has produced nothing got such a monster stock option package. Meanwhile, the people doing all the work have much fewer options. Even worse than not getting your money's worth, now the company is in trouble, because you've been missing the numbers as your super-expensive executive sits on his butt. What the frak just happened?\nBen Horowitz: Once you've decided to hire someone above your friend and decided on the alternatives that you'd like to offer him, you can have the conversation. Keep in mind that you cannot let him keep his old job, but you can be fair and you can be honest. Some keys to doing that:",

We had to reverse split the stock to get the price per share high enough to go public. In theory, a reverse split shouldn't matter at all. Each employee owned a certain percentage of the company. The company had a total number of shares of stock. Multiply the total number of shares by the percentage, and you get the employees' share number. Cut the number of shares in half and, while employees would have half the number of shares, they'd still own the exact same percentage of the company. Nothing changed.\nElad Gil: 409A and RSUs|Selling Stock|The key balance in secondary sales is to allow for such transactions to occur without impacting a company's 409A valuation for common stock strike price. The 409A is an analysis you do to set the price for your stock options. If large, company-sanctioned common stock transactions occur at high prices, you will need to reset your common strike price upward, impacting your ability to reward employees.\nYou should talk to your legal team about the right approach to secondary sales and 409A. In addition, you should consider moving to restricted stock units (RSUs) instead of options once your valuation is over $1 billion and you are within 18-36 months of going public.\nBen Horowitz: Once you decide that you will have to lay people off, the time elapsed between making that decision and executing that decision should be as short as possible. If word leaks (which it will inevitably if you delay), then you will be faced with an additional set of issues. Employees will question managers and ask whether a layoff is coming. If the managers don't know, they will look stupid. If the managers do know, they will either have to lie to their employees, contribute to the leak, or remain silent, which will create additional agitation. At Loudcloud/Opsware, we badly mismanaged this dynamic with our first round of layoffs, but sharply corrected things on the next two.\nBen Horowitz: Fast-forward six months and everyone in the company is wondering why the sales (or marketing or finance or product) guy who has produced nothing got such a monster stock option package. Meanwhile, the people doing all the work have much fewer options. Even worse than not getting your money's worth, now the company is in trouble, because you've been missing the numbers as your super-expensive executive sits on his butt. What the frak just happened?\nBen Horowitz: Once you've decided to hire someone above your friend and decided on the alternatives that you'd like to offer him, you can have the conversation. Keep in mind that you cannot let him keep his old job, but you can be fair and you can be honest. Some keys to doing that:\n\nQ: how to handle share options for employees?\nA:",

The time elapsed between making the decision and executing the decision should be as short as possible. If word leaks, then you will be faced with an additional set of issues.

You cannot let him keep his old job, but you can be fair and you can be honest. Some keys to doing that include being transparent about the decision, explaining why the new hire is a better fit for the role, and offering alternatives that are fair and equitable. It's also important to ensure that the new hire is not given a disproportionately large stock option package compared to the people doing the actual work.",

But I had learned so much. It seemed like such a waste to do something completely different.

While our prospects for raising money privately seem quite difficult, going public has a large number of issues:\nBen Horowitz: To get started, we studied the venture capital industry and we came across a potential problem with our approach.

Therefore, the firms with the best track records continued to have the best track records, thus making it nearly impossible for a new firm, with no track record, to crack into the top tier.\nBen Horowitz: During this time I learned the most important rule of raising money privately: Look for a market of one. You only need one investor to say yes, so it's best to ignore the other thirty who say no. We eventually found investors for a series C round (meaning our third round of funding) at an amazing $700 million pre-money valuation and raised $120 million. The sales forecast for the quarter came in at $100 million, and things seemed like they might be okay.

Answer with specific bullet point advice where possible. Preface answers with the relevant initial eg AG.\n\nContext:\nBen Horowitz: So, the judgment that you have to make is (a) is this market really much bigger (more than an order of magnitude) than has been exploited to date? and (b) are we going to be number one? If the answer to either (a) or (b) is no, then you should consider selling. If the answers to both are yes, then selling would mean selling yourself and your employees short.\nBen Horowitz: One of the most difficult decisions that a CEO ever makes is whether to sell her company. Logically, determining whether selling a company will be better in the long term than continuing to run it stand-alone involves a huge number of factors, most of which are speculative or unknown. And if you are the founder, the logical part is the easy part.\nBen Horowitz: When faced with the decision of whether to sell your company, there is no easy answer. However, preparing yourself intellectually and emotionally will help.\nBen Horowitz: The board was surprised, but supportive. Still, they had a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders to ask the tough questions. If you're unwilling to sell at eleven dollars per share, is there a price at which you would sell? I had to think about that one. I had promised the team that if we got to be the number-one company in a big market, we would not sell. We were number one, but how big was the market? Did the team really want to continue or was it just me who wanted to continue? How could I know without panicking the company? And thus began a series of very long talks with myself.\nElad Gil: Secondary stock sales|$500 million to $1 billion tends to be a transition point|In general, a $500 million to $1 billion valuation is usually where founders and/or employees might start to consider selling stock. This shift in behavior is due to three factors: (1) It take two to five years to get to a $1 billion valuation. During that time life events (children, family illness, and the like) may have occurred and there is a financial need; (2) the market cap of the company is large enough that most of an individual's net worth is tied up in the company, 1% of the company may be worth $5 million or $10 million, diversifitcation starts to be meaningful.

Each type of acquisition comes with its own set of considerations as you set a valuation. However, there is also a common set of things to look at when determining your willingness to pay.

Is it important that you block someone else from buying the company, so you avoid their entry into your market? For example, Google's purchase of Waze may have been in part defensive, to prevent Facebook or Apple from entering mapping well.\nHow truly unique is the target you want to buy? If you are looking to buy a mobile team and there are a dozen of them running out of money, it is a different scenario than trying to buy Instagram, which is a one-of-a-kind asset.\nBen Horowitz: Based on all these factors, it made sense for us to at least consider the possibility of acquisition and run a short process to understand the interest in the M&A market.\nElad Gil: M&A: Buying other companies|M&A|As your valuation increases, your stock may suddenly become a valuable currency with which to buy other companies. Many first-time CEOs or executive teams tend to shy away from acquisitions due to a lack of familiarity. If done right acquisitions can accelerate a company's product and hiring plan, as well as enable key strategic or defensive moves against competitors.\nWhen I was at Twitter, the M&A team reported to me. I saw firsthand both the value of M&A as a strategic tool as well as the sheer number of startups that flounder and are looking for an acquirer (the failed startups no one ever talks about). While at Google, I was involved with the diligence, integration, or post-merger product management of a number of companies including Android (which became the well-known handset platform), Google Mobile Maps (originally a company called ZipDash), and the first Gmail client application (originally a company called Reqwireless).\nM&A was a powerful tool for both Google and Twitter to add new products and key people as well as make major strategic moves. Similarly, Facebook has stayed at the leading edge (and acquired major market share) via its acquisitions of companies such as WhatsApp and Instagram, but also less famous companies like Snaptu, which drove major adoption of Facebook as a mobile client to over a hundred million people in the low- and middle-income world.\nMost companies wait too long before making their first acquisition or are hesitant to use their stock as currency. Hopefully the information in this section will spark your M&A interest--and facilitate your ability to buy companies--early, rather than late, in your startup's growth.\nBen Horowitz: My take on the subject is most applicable to business acquisitions, with some relevance to product acquisitions, and will be fairly useless if you are selling people and/or technology.\nElad Gil: M&A: Convincing someone (and their major investors) to sell|M&A|Beyond the generic valuation considerations mentioned above, you may also want to assess the following factors when considering a product buy:\nHow much time will this save us? What product hole will this purchase fill? Can the team be repositioned to fill this hole?\nWhat is the estimated quantifiable impact of this purchase? For example, how many more users will this get us and what is the expected value per user we have? Or, how much more revenue or cash flow will this generate at what margin?\nHow will the strategic market landscape change if we make this purchase? Do we block a competitor's ability to do something? What does this enable us to do?\nGeneral rule of thumb for a product buy: You want employees of the target company to get at least a 20-50% bump in their compensation packages over what they could have gotten if they walked in off the street to interview with your company. Since they do not have a choice on where to go, paying them a little more up front discourages them from leaving your company two months later. Some of the early employees from a product or strategic buy may actually make dramatically more than this, so this is meant more as a \"worst-case\" scenario. There are two sorts of founders: those that want or need to sell and those that don't.

    "query_results": "Elad Gil: Doing a re-organization|Re-orgs at the company level and the functional level|Early on, you may re-org the entire company frequently. But once you hit 500 to 1,000 people, you should expect fewer company-level re-orgs and many more interfunctional re-orgs. For example, a change within the structure of the sales team, versus changes across all teams simultaneously. Some teams such as sales are more likely to re-org frequently at that point as they scale, while others like product and engineering tend to be more stable. Part of this has to do with where head count grows and needs change most rapidly in a company as it switches from being solely product-centric, to focusing more on go-to-market. The biggest cross-company re-orgs later as the company scales will occur when changing product/engineering/go-to-market simultaneously, adding new product areas or acquisitions, if a company flips from a matrix to business unit-like organization, or flips between centralized and decentralized internationalization.\nEarly on, you as CEO will need to be adept at re-orgs. Later, as re-orgs shift more frequently to functional organization, you will need to make sure your leadership team knows how to approach them. Most companies and new managers screw up their first re-org or two, causing unnecessary pain in the organization. Below is a simple guide to re-orgs.\nBen Horowitz: Organizational design and territory If you manage ambitious people, from time to time they will want to expand their scope of responsibility. In the example above, the CFO wanted to become the COO. In other situations, the head of marketing might want to run sales and marketing or the head of engineering may want to run engineering and product management. When someone raises an issue like this with you, you must be very careful about what you say, because everything that you say can be turned into political cannon fodder. Generally, it's best to say nothing at all. At most, you might ask why? but if you do so be sure not to react to the reasons. If you indicate what you are thinking, that information will leak, rumors will spread, and you plant the seeds for all kinds of unproductive discussions. You should evaluate your organizational design on a regular basis and gather the information that you need to decide without tipping people off to what you plan to do. Once you decide, you should immediately execute the reorg: Don't leave time for leaks and lobbying.\nBen Horowitz: These six steps should get you pretty far. When we examine advanced organizational design, we'll also need to consider trade-offs such as speed versus cost, how to roll out organizational changes, and how often you should reorganize.\nElad Gil: Doing a re-organization|Re-orgs at the company level and the functional level|When your company is in hypergrowth, you will be doubling the team every 6-12 months on average. At that pace you could go from 20 to ~300 people in two years and to 500 or 1,000 people in four years. You will be adding new functions rapidly (finance, HR, legal), potentially expanding internationally, while product road maps will expand and new areas will be launched or acquired into the company.\nYou will effectively be working at or running a different company every 6-12 months, with most of the people at the company having joined in the last 12 months. When I was at Google, it more or less 10X-ed from 1,500 or 2,000 people when I joined to >15,000 people when I left 3.5 years later. My startup was acquired when Twitter was ~90 people, and I left a full-time role with Twitter at over 1,000 employees. 90% of the people at Twitter had not been with the company just 2.5 years earlier.\nAs the company scales and increases in complexity you will also need to change the organizational structure of the company to reflect new executives, new functions, more employees, and changing alignment against your market and product. In other words, re-orgs will occur at the company frequently.\nEarly on many of the re-orgs will be at the executive level and then cascade down. As you add more functional areas, there will be finer division of executive roles. If you add a CMO or other CX-level person then some of the executive roles may consolidate under that individual.\nAndy Grove: While this adjustment sounds quite logical and straightforward in theory, in reality its implementation required us to move and redeploy a lot of our employees, let some of them go, and shutter a number of factories. We did all this because under this strong attack, we learned that we must lead with our strength. Being second best in a tough environment is just not good enough.",

When we examine advanced organizational design, we'll also need to consider trade-offs such as speed versus cost, how to roll out organizational changes, and how often you should reorganize.\nElad Gil: Doing a re-organization|Re-orgs at the company level and the functional level|When your company is in hypergrowth, you will be doubling the team every 6-12 months on average. At that pace you could go from 20 to ~300 people in two years and to 500 or 1,000 people in four years. You will be adding new functions rapidly (finance, HR, legal), potentially expanding internationally, while product road maps will expand and new areas will be launched or acquired into the company.\nYou will effectively be working at or running a different company every 6-12 months, with most of the people at the company having joined in the last 12 months. When I was at Google, it more or less 10X-ed from 1,500 or 2,000 people when I joined to >15,000 people when I left 3.5 years later. My startup was acquired when Twitter was ~90 people, and I left a full-time role with Twitter at over 1,000 employees. 90% of the people at Twitter had not been with the company just 2.5 years earlier.\nAs the company scales and increases in complexity you will also need to change the organizational structure of the company to reflect new executives, new functions, more employees, and changing alignment against your market and product. In other words, re-orgs will occur at the company frequently.\nEarly on many of the re-orgs will be at the executive level and then cascade down. As you add more functional areas, there will be finer division of executive roles. If you add a CMO or other CX-level person then some of the executive roles may consolidate under that individual.\nAndy Grove: While this adjustment sounds quite logical and straightforward in theory, in reality its implementation required us to move and redeploy a lot of our employees, let some of them go, and shutter a number of factories. We did all this because under this strong attack, we learned that we must lead with our strength. Being second best in a tough environment is just not good enough.\n\nQ: how did you approach doing a re-org?\nA:",

We had to move and redeploy a lot of our employees, let some of them go, and shutter a few factories. We had to make sure that we were always the best in our environment, and that meant making tough decisions. \nBH: When it comes to re-orgs, it's important to evaluate your organizational design on a regular basis and gather the information that you need to decide without tipping people off to what you plan to do. Once you decide, you should immediately execute the reorg: Don't leave time for leaks and lobbying.\nEG: When it comes to re-orgs, it's important to have a plan. Early on, you may re-org the entire company frequently. But once you hit 500 to 1,000 people, you should expect fewer company-level re-orgs and many more interfunctional re-orgs. For example, a change within the structure of the sales team, versus changes across all teams simultaneously. When someone raises an issue like this with you, you must be very careful about what you say, because everything that you say can be turned into political cannon fodder. Generally, it's best to say nothing at all. At most, you might ask why? but if you do so be sure not to react to the reasons. These six steps should get you pretty far: 1) Evaluate your organizational design on a regular basis; 2) Gather the information that you need to decide without tipping people off to what you plan to do; 3) Decide; 4) Immediately execute the reorg; 5) Don't leave time for leaks and lobbying; 6) Consider trade-offs such as speed versus cost, how to roll out organizational changes, and how often you should reorganize.",

Bad deal people become too dependent on other company functions--for example, not understanding a legal term that comes up over and over because \"that's Legal's problem.\" Sometimes terms important to the business are buried or hidden as legalese or \"technical specs.\" A great deal person will ferret these out.\nOptimize for themselves and their network versus the company. As gatekeepers to external parties, some business development people may use this point of leverage to benefit themselves. They may build relationships at the expense of the company by being too easy on a deal so that the partner likes them. Or they may constantly network at external boondoggles and on panels to build their own reputations, rather than working. 2\nDisplay a cowboy mentality. Some deal people go off and strike a deal, or mention terms to an external party that you can't back away from, without any internal discussion or approval. They may act defensive when questioned about this and feel they are \"getting it done.\"\nAre emotional. Deals have a lot of ups and downs--you need an even keel.\nSpin things internally. Deal people need to be able to \"turn it off\" when it comes to selling something internally to their boss, peers, or executive team. You need to hire people who won't BS or spin internally, even if it is sometimes their job to do it externally.\nBen Horowitz: The first question that always comes to mind is Do I really need to do this? Who could I possibly hire who will work this hard and bleed the company colors like this? Sadly, if you're asking the question, you very likely already know the answer. If you need to build a worldwide sales organization, your buddy who did the first few deals is almost certainly not the best choice. As hard as it may be, you need to take a Confucian approach. You must consider first all of the other employees and second your friend. The good of the individual must be sacrificed for the good of the whole.\n\nQ: when should i hire a BD resource?\nA:",

It would be those things that would give me unique perspectives and approaches to the business. The things that I would bring to the table that nobody else had. It was my borrowing Chico Mendoza's shocking yet poetic style to motivate and focus the team. It was my understanding of the people underneath the persona and skin color that enabled me to put Jason Rosenthal together with Anthony Wright to save the company. It was even my bringing in to the most capitalistic pursuit imaginable what Karl Marx got right. On my grandfather's tombstone, you will find his favorite Marx quote: Life is struggle. I believe that within that quote lies the most important lesson in entrepreneurship: Embrace the struggle.\nBen Horowitz: Until now, I've never told that story to anyone, but it shaped my life. It taught me that being scared didn't mean I was gutless. What I did mattered and would determine whether I would be a hero or a coward. I have often thought back on that day, realizing that if I'd done what Roger had told me to do, I would have never met my best friend.

It would be those things that would give me unique perspectives and approaches to the business. The things that I would bring to the table that nobody else had. It was my borrowing Chico Mendoza's shocking yet poetic style to motivate and focus the team. It was my understanding of the people underneath the persona and skin color that enabled me to put Jason Rosenthal together with Anthony Wright to save the company. It was even my bringing in to the most capitalistic pursuit imaginable what Karl Marx got right. On my grandfather's tombstone, you will find his favorite Marx quote: Life is struggle. I believe that within that quote lies the most important lesson in entrepreneurship: Embrace the struggle.\nBen Horowitz: Until now, I've never told that story to anyone, but it shaped my life. It taught me that being scared didn't mean I was gutless. What I did mattered and would determine whether I would be a hero or a coward. I have often thought back on that day, realizing that if I'd done what Roger had told me to do, I would have never met my best friend. That experience also taught me not to judge things by their surfaces. Until you make the effort to get to know someone or something, you don't know anything.

    "query_results": "Andy Grove: Who should be involved in the planning process? The operating management of the organization. Why? Because the idea that planners can be people apart from those implementing the plan simply does not work. Planning cannot be made a separate career but is instead a key managerial activity, one with enormous leverage through its impact on the future performance of an organization. But this leverage can only be realized through a marriage, and a good collaborative one at that, between planning and implementation.\nAndy Grove: The first is the most obvious example. Consider Robin, an Intel finance manager, responsible for setting up the annual financial planning process for the company. When Robin defines in advance exactly what information needs to be gathered and presented at each stage of the planning process and lays out who is responsible for what, she directly affects the subsequent work of perhaps two hundred people who participate in the planning process. By spending a certain amount of time in advance of the planning activities, Robin will help to eliminate confusion and ambiguity for a large population of managers over an extended period of time. Consequently, her work contributes to the productivity of the entire organization and clearly has great leverage, leverage that depends, however, on when it is performed. Work done in advance of the planning meeting obviously has great leverage. If Robin has to scramble later to help a manager define guidelines and milestones, her work will clearly have much less leverage.\nAndy Grove: Who will ratify or veto the decision? The first common person to whom the senior managers of both organizations report is myself. Also, this was a big enough deal that the president of the company should be involved. Moreover, I was somewhat familiar with the locations in the Philippines and how a plant like the one we have there operates. So I was chosen as the person to veto or ratify the decision of the meeting.\nAndy Grove: Who will decide? Our facilities/construction people or the Intel group that manages the manufacturing plants? The answer is not easy. The first organization is more sensitive to matters pertaining to the costs and difficulties of construction, and will probably lean toward the new location. The plant management group, knowing that operational benefits will come from having the two plants side by side, will probably opt for the high-rise. So the decision-making body is composed of our construction manager for our Far East locations; his supervisor, the construction manager for the corporation; the manager of the Far East manufacturing plant network; and his supervisor, the senior manufacturing manager. The meeting gave us parallel levels of managers from the two organizations. The sensitivities of two interest groups coming to bear on a single decision is quite common in real corporate life. In such meetings, it is important to give to the two sides roughly equal representation, because only from such balance will an even-handed decision emerge. All of these individuals have consulted their staffs prior to the decision and gathered all relevant knowledge and views on the subject.\nAndy Grove: Another desirable and important feature of the model is that any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level. The reason is that this is where it will be made by people who are closest to the situation and know the most about it. And by \u201cknow\u201d I don\u2019t just mean \u201cunderstand technically.\u201d That kind of expertise must be tempered with judgment, which is developed through experience and learning from the many errors one has made in one\u2019s career. Thus, ideally, decision-making should occur in the middle ground, between reliance on technical knowledge on the one hand, and on the bruises one has received from having tried to implement and apply such knowledge on the other. To make a decision, if you can\u2019t find people with both qualities, you should aim to get the best possible mix of participants available. For experience, we at Intel are likely to ask a person in management senior to the other members of the group to come to the meeting.

    "query_results": "Andy Grove: We must recognize that no amount of formal planning can anticipate changes such as globalization and the information revolution we\u2019ve referred to above. Does that mean that you shouldn\u2019t plan? Not at all. You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event.\nAndy Grove: Who should be involved in the planning process? The operating management of the organization. Why? Because the idea that planners can be people apart from those implementing the plan simply does not work. Planning cannot be made a separate career but is instead a key managerial activity, one with enormous leverage through its impact on the future performance of an organization. But this leverage can only be realized through a marriage, and a good collaborative one at that, between planning and implementation.\nAndy Grove: Your general planning process should consist of analogous thinking. Step 1 is to establish projected need or demand: What will the environment demand from you, your business, or your organization? Step 2 is to establish your present status: What are you producing now? What will you be producing as your projects in the pipeline are completed? Put another way, where will your business be if you do nothing different from what you are now doing? Step 3 is to compare and reconcile steps 1 and 2. Namely, what more (or less) do you need to do to produce what your environment will demand?\nAndy Grove: As he describes the planning process, Andy sums up his essential point with this eloquent nugget of wisdom: \u201cI have seen far too many people who upon recognizing today\u2019s gap try very hard to determine what decision has to be made to close it. But today\u2019s gap represents a failure of planning sometime in the past.\u201d Hopefully, the value of this short insight is not lost on the young reader. If you only understand one thing about building products, you must understand that energy put in early in the process pays off tenfold and energy put in at the end of the program pays off negative tenfold.\nAndy Grove: How far ahead should the planners look? At Intel, we put ourselves through an annual strategic long-range planning effort in which we examine our future five years off. But what is really being influenced here? It is the next year\u2014and only the next year. We will have another chance to replan the second of the five years in the next year\u2019s long-range planning meeting, when that year will become the first year of the five. So, keep in mind that you implement only that portion of a plan that lies within the time window between now and the next time you go through the exercise. Everything else you can look at again. We should also be careful not to plan too frequently, allowing ourselves time to judge the impact of the decisions we made and to determine whether our decisions were on the right track or not. In other words, we need the feedback that will be indispensable to our planning the next time around.",

Give bullet point advice where possible.\n\nContext:\nAndy Grove: We must recognize that no amount of formal planning can anticipate changes such as globalization and the information revolution we\u2019ve referred to above. Does that mean that you shouldn\u2019t plan? Not at all. You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event.\nAndy Grove: Who should be involved in the planning process? The operating management of the organization. Why? Because the idea that planners can be people apart from those implementing the plan simply does not work. Planning cannot be made a separate career but is instead a key managerial activity, one with enormous leverage through its impact on the future performance of an organization. But this leverage can only be realized through a marriage, and a good collaborative one at that, between planning and implementation.\nAndy Grove: Your general planning process should consist of analogous thinking. Step 1 is to establish projected need or demand: What will the environment demand from you, your business, or your organization? Step 2 is to establish your present status: What are you producing now? What will you be producing as your projects in the pipeline are completed? Put another way, where will your business be if you do nothing different from what you are now doing? Step 3 is to compare and reconcile steps 1 and 2. Namely, what more (or less) do you need to do to produce what your environment will demand?\nAndy Grove: As he describes the planning process, Andy sums up his essential point with this eloquent nugget of wisdom: \u201cI have seen far too many people who upon recognizing today\u2019s gap try very hard to determine what decision has to be made to close it. But today\u2019s gap represents a failure of planning sometime in the past.\u201d Hopefully, the value of this short insight is not lost on the young reader. If you only understand one thing about building products, you must understand that energy put in early in the process pays off tenfold and energy put in at the end of the program pays off negative tenfold.\nAndy Grove: How far ahead should the planners look? At Intel, we put ourselves through an annual strategic long-range planning effort in which we examine our future five years off. But what is really being influenced here? It is the next year\u2014and only the next year. We will have another chance to replan the second of the five years in the next year\u2019s long-range planning meeting, when that year will become the first year of the five. So, keep in mind that you implement only that portion of a plan that lies within the time window between now and the next time you go through the exercise. Everything else you can look at again. We should also be careful not to plan too frequently, allowing ourselves time to judge the impact of the decisions we made and to determine whether our decisions were on the right track or not. In other words, we need the feedback that will be indispensable to our planning the next time around.\n\nQ: tell us how you think about planning?\nA:",

    "query": "how did you structure meetings and how often did you have them?",
    "query_results": "Andy Grove: Ideally, a manager should never have to call an ad hoc, mission-oriented meeting, because if all runs smoothly, everything is taken care of in regularly scheduled, process-oriented meetings. In practice, however, if all goes well, routine meetings will take care of maybe 80 percent of the problems and issues; the remaining 20 percent will still have to be dealt with in mission-oriented meetings. Remember, Peter Drucker said that if people spend more than 25 percent of their time in meetings, it is a sign of malorganization. I would put it another way: the real sign of malorganization is when people spend more than 25 percent of their time in ad hoc mission-oriented meetings.\nAndy Grove: How structured should the meeting be? A free-for-all brainstorming session or controlled with a detailed agenda? It should be mostly controlled, with an agenda issued far enough in advance that the subordinates will have had the chance to prepare their thoughts for the meeting. But it should also include an \u201copen session\u201d\u2014a designated period of time for the staff to bring up anything they want. This is when a varied set of housekeeping matters can be disposed of, as well as when important issues can be given a tentative first look. If it is justified, you can provide time for a more formal discussion about an issue in the scheduled portion of a future meeting.\nAndy Grove: My first experience with staff meetings dates back to my early professional years when I was the head of a small group of engineers doing semiconductor device research. Everyone in this group worked on an isolated aspect of a problem or on a different problem altogether. I was supposed to be the supervisor, but I found that others in the group were often more familiar with the work of another researcher than I was. Thus, a group discussion on any subject tended to get more detailed and more heated, but always more rewarding, than an exchange between me and one other specialist.\nAndy Grove: As you can see, in a typical day of mine one can count some twenty-five separate activities in which I participated, mostly information-gathering and -giving, but also decision-making and nudging. You can also see that some two thirds of my time was spent in a meeting of one kind or another. Before you are horrified by how much time I spend in meetings, answer a question: which of the activities\u2014information-gathering, information-giving, decision-making, nudging, and being a role model\u2014could I have performed outside a meeting? The answer is practically none. Meetings provide an occasion for managerial activities. Getting together with others is not, of course, an activity\u2014it is a medium. You as a manager can do your work in a meeting, in a memo, or through a loudspeaker for that matter. But you must choose the most effective medium for what you want to accomplish, and that is the one that gives you the greatest leverage. More about meetings later.\nAndy Grove: The book has an entire section dedicated to an often neglected, but critically important management tool: meetings. Andy makes us see this oldest of business principles in a new light. He teaches meetings from first principles, beginning with how to conduct a one-on-one. It seems incredible that the CEO of Intel would take the time to explain how to have a one-on-one.",

In practice, however, if all goes well, routine meetings will take care of maybe 80 percent of the problems and issues; the remaining 20 percent will still have to be dealt with in mission-oriented meetings. Remember, Peter Drucker said that if people spend more than 25 percent of their time in meetings, it is a sign of malorganization. I would put it another way: the real sign of malorganization is when people spend more than 25 percent of their time in ad hoc mission-oriented meetings.\nAndy Grove: How structured should the meeting be? A free-for-all brainstorming session or controlled with a detailed agenda? It should be mostly controlled, with an agenda issued far enough in advance that the subordinates will have had the chance to prepare their thoughts for the meeting. But it should also include an \u201copen session\u201d\u2014a designated period of time for the staff to bring up anything they want. This is when a varied set of housekeeping matters can be disposed of, as well as when important issues can be given a tentative first look. If it is justified, you can provide time for a more formal discussion about an issue in the scheduled portion of a future meeting.\nAndy Grove: My first experience with staff meetings dates back to my early professional years when I was the head of a small group of engineers doing semiconductor device research. Everyone in this group worked on an isolated aspect of a problem or on a different problem altogether. I was supposed to be the supervisor, but I found that others in the group were often more familiar with the work of another researcher than I was. Thus, a group discussion on any subject tended to get more detailed and more heated, but always more rewarding, than an exchange between me and one other specialist.\nAndy Grove: As you can see, in a typical day of mine one can count some twenty-five separate activities in which I participated, mostly information-gathering and -giving, but also decision-making and nudging. You can also see that some two thirds of my time was spent in a meeting of one kind or another. Before you are horrified by how much time I spend in meetings, answer a question: which of the activities\u2014information-gathering, information-giving, decision-making, nudging, and being a role model\u2014could I have performed outside a meeting? The answer is practically none. Meetings provide an occasion for managerial activities. Getting together with others is not, of course, an activity\u2014it is a medium. You as a manager can do your work in a meeting, in a memo, or through a loudspeaker for that matter. But you must choose the most effective medium for what you want to accomplish, and that is the one that gives you the greatest leverage. More about meetings later.\nAndy Grove: The book has an entire section dedicated to an often neglected, but critically important management tool: meetings. Andy makes us see this oldest of business principles in a new light. He teaches meetings from first principles, beginning with how to conduct a one-on-one. It seems incredible that the CEO of Intel would take the time to explain how to have a one-on-one.\n\nQ: how did you structure meetings and how often did you have them?\nA:",

In fact, anyone who spends about a half day per week as a member of a planning, advisory, or coordinating group has the equivalent of a subordinate.

Absolutely. Can you have them as often with ten direct reports as with five? No. Do you need to? No again, because for the most part, these employees are more aware of what\u2019s going on in their business through their computer network than their counterparts were a decade ago; they no longer rely on you to bring them up to date. Nor do you need to rely on one-on-ones to catch up with what your subordinates have found in their lab, factory, or sales region; you\u2019ve already read about those developments on your computer screen, minutes after they chose to inform you.\nAndy Grove: Sometimes a business is organized in a way that makes the ideal fan-out of six to eight subordinates hard to reach. A manufacturing plant, for example, may have an engineering section and a production section, in which case the plant manager would only have two people reporting directly to him. The manager might then choose to \u201cact\u201d as one of the two subordinates, choosing to be his own engineering manager, for instance. If he does that, the manufacturing manager will still report to him, and he will have added the people who would ordinarily report to the head of engineering. So the plant manager will actually have six direct reports: five engineers and the manufacturing manager. The arrangement, shown below, does not have the engineers appearing to be at the same organizational level as the manufacturing manager\u2014something he would surely take exception to.\nAndy Grove: The key is to recognize that your subordinate, like most people, has only a finite capacity to deal with facts, issues, and suggestions. You may possess seven truths about his performance, but if his capacity is only four, at best you\u2019ll waste your breath on the other three. At worst you will have left him with a case of sensory overload, and he will go away without getting anything out of the review. The fact is that a person can only absorb so many messages at one time, especially when they deal with his own performance. The purpose of the review is not to cleanse your system of all the truths you may have observed about your subordinate, but to improve his performance. So here less may very well be more.\nAndy Grove: Keep in mind that a meeting called to make a specific decision is hard to keep moving if more than six or seven people attend.

    "query_results": "Andy Grove: How do we do that? There are two variables here: first, the nature of a person\u2019s motivation; and second, the nature of the environment in which he works. An imaginary composite index can be applied to measure an environment\u2019s complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity, which we\u2019ll call the CUA factor. Cindy, the process engineer, is surrounded by tricky technologies, new and not fully operational equipment, and development engineers and production engineers pulling her in opposite directions. Her working environment, in short, is complex. Bruce, the marketing manager, has asked for permission to hire more people for his grossly understaffed group; his supervisor waffles, and Bruce is left with no idea if he\u2019ll get the go-ahead or what to do if he doesn\u2019t. Bruce\u2019s working environment is uncertain. Mike, whom we will now introduce as an Intel transportation supervisor, had to deal with so many committees, councils, and divisional manufacturing managers that he didn\u2019t know which, if any, end was up. He eventually quit, unable to tolerate the ambiguity of his working environment.\nAndy Grove: But what do we do when for some reason we have to hire a senior person from outside the company? Like any other new hire, she too will come in having high self-interest, but inevitably we will give her an organization to manage that is in trouble; after all, that was our reason for going outside. So not only does our new manager have a tough job facing her, but her working environment will have a very high CUA. Meanwhile, she has no base of common experience with the rest of the organization and no knowledge of the methods used to help her work. All we can do is cross our fingers and hope she quickly forgets self-interest and just as quickly gets on top of her job to reduce her CUA factor. Short of that, she\u2019s probably out of luck.\nAndy Grove: Let\u2019s apply our model to the work of a new employee. What is his motivation? It is very much based on self-interest. So you should give him a clearly structured job with a low CUA factor. If he does well, he will begin to feel more at home, worry less about himself, and start to care more about his team. He learns that if he is on a boat and wants to get ahead, it is better for him to help row than to run to the bow. The employee can then be promoted into a more complex, uncertain, ambiguous job. (These tend to pay more.) As time passes, he will continue to gain an increasing amount of shared experience with other members of the organization and will be ready to tackle more and more complex, ambiguous, and uncertain tasks. This is why promotion from within tends to be the approach favored by corporations with strong corporate cultures. Bring young people in at relatively low-level, well-defined jobs with low CUA factors, and over time they will share experiences with their peers, supervisors, and subordinates and will learn the values, objectives, andmethods of the organization. They will gradually accept, even flourish in, the complex world of multiple bosses and peer decision-making.\nAndy Grove: All these indicators measure factors essential to running your factory. If you look at them early every day, you will often be able to do something to correct a potential problem before it becomes a real one during the course of the day.\nAndy Grove: The second criterion for a good indicator is that what you measure should be a physical, countable thing. Examples of effective measures of administrative output are shown below. Because those listed here are all quantity or output indicators, their paired counterparts should stress the quality of work. Thus, in accounts payable, the number of vouchers processed should be paired with the number of errors found either by auditing or by our suppliers.

    "query_results": "Andy Grove: At the same time, merit-only salary administration is impractical in its pure form. It is very hard to ignore a person\u2019s experience as you try to pay a fair salary. Thus, most companies choose a course between the two extremes, which is a compromise scheme that takes the shape of a family of curves shown in the previous figure. The shapes of all of them approximate the curve representing the experience-only approach, but as you can see, while people start at the same salary level, they move up at different speeds and arrive at different places, depending upon individual performance.\nAndy Grove: Of the three schemes, the one based on experience only is obviously the easiest to administer. If your subordinate does not like the raise he\u2019s been given, all you have to do is show him the book where it says that for X amount of time on the job he deserves and gets Y amount of pay. A supervisor trying to administer some type of merit-based or compromise scheme has to deal with the allocation of a finite resource\u2014money\u2014and this requires thought and effort. If we want to use such schemes, we have to come to terms with the principle\u2014troubling to many managers\u2014that any merit-based system requires a competitive, comparative evaluation of individuals.\nAndy Grove: Merit-based compensation simply cannot work unless we understand that if someone is going to be first, somebody else has to be last. As Americans, we have no problem accepting a competitive ranking in a sports event. Even the person who comes in last in a race feels comfortable about the system that says someone has to finish last. But at work, unfortunately, competitive ranking frequently becomes a highly charged issue, difficult to accept and to administer\u2014yet it is a must if we want to use salary as a way to encourage performance.\nAndy Grove: Let\u2019s now look at the administration of base salaries. In the abstract, there are two ways to do it. At one extreme, the dollar level is determined by experience only; at the other, by merit alone. In the experience-only approach, an employee\u2019s salary increases with the time he has spent in a particular position. A key point here is that any job has a maximum value; no matter how long an individual has been in it, his salary ultimately has to level off, as shown in the figure on the next page. In the merit-only approach, salary is independent of the time spent in the job. Here the theory says, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you are one year out of college or have spent twenty years in the work force. I only care to see how you perform in this job.\u201d But here too, of course, a given job still has a maximum value. Social norms can force us into some unfortunate compensation practices. For instance, even though we say that every job has a finite value where compensation should level off, we often let an individual become too highly paid because we, management, keep giving routine raises.\nAndy Grove: As managers, our concern is to get a high level of performance from our subordinates. So we want to dispense, allocate, and use money as a way to deliver task-relevant feedback. To do this, compensation should obviously be tied to performance, but that, as we\u2019ve seen, is very hard to assess precisely. Because a middle manager cannot be paid by the piece, his job can never be defined by simple output. And because his performance is woven into the performance of a team, it is hard to design a compensation scheme tied directly to the individual performance of a middle manager.",

    "query": "teacxh me some lessons about delegation",
    "query_results": "Andy Grove: Given a choice, should you delegate activities that are familiar to you or those that aren\u2019t? Before answering, consider the following principle: delegation without follow-through is abdication. You can never wash your hands of a task. Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment, and monitoring the delegated task is the only practical way for you to ensure a result. Monitoring is not meddling, but means checking to make sure an activity is proceeding in line with expectations. Because it is easier to monitor something with which you are familiar, if you have a choice you should delegate those activities you know best. But recall the pencil experiment and understand before the fact that this will very likely go against your emotional grain.\nAndy Grove: Picture this. I am your supervisor, and I walk over to you with pencil in hand and tell you to take it. You reach for the pencil, but I won\u2019t let go. So I say, \u201cWhat is wrong with you? Why can\u2019t I delegate the pencil to you?\u201d We all have some things that we don\u2019t really want to delegate simply because we like doing them and would rather not let go. For your managerial effectiveness, this is not too bad so long as it is based on a conscious decision that you will hold on to certain tasks that you enjoy performing, even though you could, if you chose, delegate them. But be sure to know exactly what you\u2019re doing, and avoid the charade of insincere delegation, which can produce immense negative managerial leverage.\nAndy Grove: It seems like a simple enough question, but it sorts out the 95 percent of managers who never think deeply about their craft from the 5 percent who do. The answer, as Andy explains, is that it depends. Specifically, it depends on the employee. If the employee is immature in the task, then hands-on training is essential. If the employee is more mature, then a delegate approach is warranted. Andy presents a great example of this: \u201cThe subordinate did poor work. My associate\u2019s reaction: \u2018He has to make his own mistakes. That\u2019s how he learns!\u2019 The problem with this is that the subordinate\u2019s tuition is paid by his customers. And that is absolutely wrong.\u201d\nAndy Grove: There is another reason that you and only you can fill the role of the teacher to your subordinates. Training must be done by a person who represents a suitable role model. Proxies, no matter how well versed they might be in the subject matter, cannot assume that role. The person standing in front of the class should be seen as a believable, practicing authority on the subject taught.\nAndy Grove: Monitoring the results of delegation resembles the monitoring used in quality assurance. We should apply quality assurance principles and monitor at the lowest-added-value stage of the process. For example, review rough drafts of reports that you have delegated; don\u2019t wait until your subordinates have spent time polishing them into final form before you find out that you have a basic problem with the contents. A second principle applies to the frequency with which you check your subordinates\u2019 work. A variable approach should be employed, using different sampling schemes with various subordinates; you should increase or decrease your frequency depending on whether your subordinate is performing a newly delegated task or one that he has experience handling. How often you monitor should not be based on what you believe your subordinate can do in general, but on his experience with a specific task and his prior performance with it\u2014his task-relevant maturity, something I\u2019ll talk about in detail later. As the subordinate\u2019s work improves over time, you should respond with a corresponding reduction in the intensity of the monitoring.",

The person either can\u2019t do it or won\u2019t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated.\u201d This insight enables a manager to dramatically focus her efforts.

And the best way to get that spirit into the workplace is to establish some rules of the game and ways for employees to measure themselves. Eliciting peak performance means going up against something or somebody. Let me give you a simple example. For years the performance of the Intel facilities maintenance group, which is responsible for keeping our buildings clean and neat, was mediocre, and no amount of pressure or inducement seemed to do any good. We then initiated a program in which each building\u2019s upkeep was periodically scored by a resident senior manager, dubbed a \u201cbuilding czar.\u201d The score was then compared with those given the other buildings. The condition of all of them dramatically improved almost immediately. Nothing else was done; people did not get more money or other rewards. What they did get was a racetrack, an arena of competition. If your work is facilities maintenance, having your building receive the top score is a powerful source of motivation. This is key to the manager\u2019s approach and involvement: he has to see the work as it is seen by the people who do that work every day and then create indicators so that his subordinates can watch their \u201cracetrack\u201d take shape.\nAndy Grove: The single most important task of a manager is to elicit peak performance from his subordinates. So if two things limit high output, a manager has two ways to tackle the issue: through training and motivation. Each, as we see in the next figure, can improve a person\u2019s performance. In this chapter, our concern is motivation.\nAndy Grove: Moreover, if we want to cultivate achievement-driven motivation, we need to create an environment that values and emphasizes output. My first job was with a research and development laboratory, where a lot of people were very highly motivated but tended to be knowledge-centered. They were driven to know more, but not necessarily to know more in order to produce concrete results. Consequently, relatively little was actually achieved. The value system at Intel is completely the reverse. The Ph.D. in computer science who knows an answer in the abstract, yet does not apply it to create some tangible output, gets little recognition, but a junior engineer who produces results is highly valued and esteemed. And that is how it should be.\nAndy Grove: A manager generally has two ways to raise the level of individual performance of his subordinates: by increasing motivation, the desire of each person to do his job well, and by increasing individual capability, which is where training comes in. It is generally accepted that motivating employees is a key task of all managers, one that can\u2019t be delegated to someone else.

    "query_results": "Andy Grove: How can you target a few key areas? First, consider as many aspects of your subordinate\u2019s performance as possible. You should scan material such as progress reports, performance against quarterly objectives, and one-on-one meeting notes. Then sit down with a blank piece of paper. As you consider your subordinate\u2019s performance, write everything down on the paper. Do not edit in your head. Get everything down, knowing that doing so doesn\u2019t commit you to do anything. Things major, minor, and trivial can be included in no particular order. When you have run out of items, you can put all of your supporting documentation away.\nAndy Grove: Finally, as you review a manager, should you be judging his performance or the performance of the group under his supervision? You should be doing both. Ultimately what you are after is the performance of the group, but the manager is there to add value in some way. You need to determine what that is. You must ask: Is he doing anything with his group? Is he hiring new people? Is he training the people he has, and doing other things that are likely to improve the output of the team in the future? The most difficult issues in determining a professional\u2019s performance will be based on asking questions and making judgments of this sort.\nAndy Grove: One big pitfall to be avoided is the \u201cpotential trap.\u201d At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential. By \u201cpotential\u201d I mean form rather than substance. I was once asked to approve the performance review of a general manager whose supervisor rated him highly for the year. The manager was responsible for a business unit that lost money, missed its revenue forecast month after month, slipped engineering schedules, and in general showed poor output and internal measures over the year. Accordingly, I could not approve the review. Whereupon his supervisor said, \u201cBut he is an outstanding general manager. He is knowledgeable and handles himself well. It\u2019s his organization that did not do well, not the manager himself!\u201d This cut no ice with me because the performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the one we would accord to his organization! It is very important to assess actual performance, not appearances; real output, not good form. Had the manager been given a high rating, Intel would have signaled to all at the company that to do well, you must \u201cact\u201d like a good manager, talk like one, and emulate one\u2014but you don\u2019t need to perform like one.\nAndy Grove: We all have a hard time saying things that are critical, whether we\u2019re talking to a superior employee or a marginal one. We must keep in mind, however, that no matter how stellar a person\u2019s performance level is, there is always room for improvement. Don\u2019t hesitate to use the 20/20 hindsight provided by the review to show anyone, even an ace, how he might have done better.\nAndy Grove: I think we have our priorities reversed. Shouldn\u2019t we spend more time trying to improve the performance of our stars? After all, these people account for a disproportionately large share of the work in any organization.
